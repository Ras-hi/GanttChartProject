1js4848,I chose not to die. I left loaded weapons on the table and walked to the hospital.,"I’m 38. I’ve been sober since 2018, married with a child, and on paper I’m doing well—career, family, stability. But inside, I’ve spent years quietly falling apart.

My first serious crash was at 22. I had gotten a girl pregnant, and before we could talk about it, she had an abortion without telling me. That destroyed me. I fell into a depression I couldn’t explain to anyone. I stopped going to class. I isolated. I drank. A lot.

One night, drunk and desperate, I emptied my bank account ($3,000) and bought a one-way Greyhound ticket to L.A. I never made it—I got robbed at the terminal, then arrested. The cops took me to a psych ward instead of jail. That might have saved my life.

Eventually I finished college. In 2011 I worked in Afghanistan with the military. We got hit with rocket attacks regularly, but I barely reacted. I wasn’t brave—I was numb. Nothing outside felt as intense as what was happening inside me.

At 27, I lost my job and ended up hospitalized again after another depressive spiral. The suicidal ideation had become familiar by that point. It would creep in and take over until I couldn’t tell if I was in danger or just tired of existing.

I didn’t stop drinking until I was 33. One morning, I left for the hospital with loaded weapons sitting on my coffee table. I made a choice not to die that day—and I’ve never forgotten it.

A doctor told me I had cirrhosis. That scared me sober. A year later, a liver specialist told me it was alcoholic hepatitis and that I’d recovered. Somehow, my body gave me a second chance.

Since then, I’ve stayed sober. I’ve been diagnosed with Major Depressive Disorder, and I’ve tried different meds. Some helped. Some triggered what I can only describe as months of euphoria. I spent thousands of dollars on Pokémon cards. I told myself it was “investing,” but really, I was spinning out.

When I crashed again, I ended up in the hospital for a week. The idea of bipolar has been brought up, but nothing formal. I don’t know what I am—other than confused.

Now, even with meds and sobriety, I’ve started raging at the smallest criticisms. It’s like this explosive anger just erupts from nowhere. I hate how it makes me feel. I hate the way it affects my wife and kid. I want to stop, but I don’t fully understand what’s happening inside me.

I’m doing everything I can. Therapy. Psychiatry. Meds. Honest reflection. And still—some days I feel like I’m right back on the edge I was at 10 years ago.

I guess I’m writing this because I needed to say it out loud. I don’t have a clean ending or an insight to offer. Just this:

I’m still here. Still trying.",Ateepeemadeofpeepee,88,18,1743861991.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1js4848/i_chose_not_to_die_i_left_loaded_weapons_on_the/,Negative,Moderate Concern,L.A.
1js5qda,Feeling down lately,"I’ve been feeling down a lot lately for no specific reason. Everything around me is going well, so I don’t know where this feeling of depression and unrest is coming from. I noticed these feelings come at LEAST once every 4 months or so and other times I feel elated and good about life. I don’t want to sound ungrateful or anything because life really has been good to me. I have trouble expressing myself verbally and don’t want to sound like a burden to those around me so I’m posting this here on Reddit for the first time. I guess I just want to know if this is a common feeling and if anybody else has these recurrent feelings of “downness” even when things are going well in life.

1js3pns,I'mm so tired,"Hi, I have been going through it so I wanna open up. As u can read on the title I'mm very tired of life. I'm 23 years old man. I have been struggling with my mental health as long as I hit puberty. Anxiety, OCD and depression. My selfconfidence was destroyed when I was child/teen by my mother. I had no friends, I was always the weird kid. 

Since then i had therapy 2022-2023, but needed to stop because the moeny. I'm highly educated, moved away from my home town to nig city and got the job I was always dreaming about. Now I'm more sad and axious than ever. 

My job is very demanding and busy. My job is district secretary so I deal with very serious cases everyday. I'mm constantly messing things up, that prerssure is just not good for my mental health. Work is my whole life. it takes 95% of my days, first at work and when I'mm back home all I can do is stress abou things I didnt have time. Weekends are mostly stressing abou work. I have no friends because i moved here last summer. I meet new people but nobody stays and wants to keep having a friendship.

1js1yup,can anyone help me figure out what's going on?,"Hi guys I'm 14 years old, I am from the Philippines, so my English may not be as good.

I have been seeing things like shadows, items that when I try touching them they disappear, random black bugs crawling around but when I turn to look at them they're not there.

I have been hearing my name being called at random times of day especially when I'm at school when no one's talking to me and random people laughing. 

All of the things mentioned above are just brief moments, and they have been happening for at least a year now. Also when these happen, I don't think im in a paranoid state nor am I worried about anything,

Recently, I've also been experiencing nightmares involving everyone I've ever loved leaving me or getting possessed, or just anything disturbing happening to them. My memories have also gotten foggier (I'm not sure if that's a word) and harder to remember, I've also seem to have gotten stupider.

My parents took me to a psychiatrist a year ago and they diagnosed me with bipolar disorder, they gave me meds for it (I don't take them anymore since they don't help) I don't think it's very much accurate because I don't think I have ever experienced a manic episode in my life. Recently my mom took me to a therapist and she told me that I might have asymptomatic depression, so I'm not sure if that contributes to what I'm experiencing rn

And before anyone says anything, I am not schizophrenic, nor have I ever experienced psychosis (I think), and I don't take drugs because I'm too young for that. That's all 4 now, if anyone with a similar experience sees this please help",QualityLegal4166,2,2,1743854800.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1js1yup/can_anyone_help_me_figure_out_whats_going_on/,Negative,Moderate Concern,Philippines
1jrwd28,I (23F) don't see a way out,"If you go to my post history, you can get a picture of how I got to where I am in life today. I am here today because of the choices I made. Currently I'm unemployed and I don't have a degree. I stay at home all day doing nothing. That's mainly how I've wasted the past five years of my life. I wish I went off to university, took it seriously, made a group of friends, and studied abroad. I wake up every day and think about how I would be studying abroad right now and the memories I would have made. There are no second chances since I come from a low income family. I ask myself why I did the things I did, even though I know that my family is working class. I don't come from a wealthy background so what made me think I had any time or money to waste? Now I am 5 years (which is a fucking long time) behind everyone and I'm watching all of my friends graduate, study in Europe (which I want but will never get to do due to finances, ruining my academic record, and running out of time), and make good money. There is literally no way to catch up to not just to my friends, but to the vision I had for my life. I also still live with my parents in the 570 sq ft one bedroom apartment that I grew up in (I sleep in the living room on a twin bed). I can't stand to live here anymore, but I'm broke. I don't even want to live in Canada anymore. Moving elsewhere likely wouldn't make me happier since I would be even more lonely than I am now. Getting a minimum wage job and moving out is not the solution because minimum wage/close to minimum wage is not sustainable for the rest of my life. The only thing I can feasibly do is get a bachelor's in nursing, but it feels like a last resort. I know I left myself with no choices. I really cannot see myself living in this city for the next 5-7 years and have been contemplating suicide. I really feel trapped and don't see a way out. I had a vision for my 20s, which would have started with a memorable time in university, but I not only missed the boat on that, I have wasted 5 years of youth that I will never get back and am left in a position where I'll be poor for a very long time. University would have been the most likely and easiest place for dating, but that option is closed to me forever. That environment is important to me because it would have been the most organic way to make friends and to meet someone my age to date. Now the time for fun has passed (during which I didn't even have fun), the only thing that's left is work, being poor, and loneliness.",Extreme-Book-1922,7,4,1743831147.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1jrwd28/i_23f_dont_see_a_way_out/,Negative,High Risk,Europe
1iwvbzn,r/Anxiety is looking for new moderators,"Hello friends!

We're looking to grow the moderation team here at [r/Anxiety](https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/). Moderators are a key part of what makes any Reddit community special. If you are interested in helping to make this community special, we'd like to talk to you.

# What does a moderator do?

Moderators here at [r/Anxiety](https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/) work to build our community and make this a safe place to discuss the many facets of anxiety and the ways that anxiety and mental wellness influence daily life. Moderators help to write the rules, respond to content concerns, set policies, update community themes and appearance, manage automation, and general upkeep.

# What are the minimum requirements to apply?

If you care about mental health and would like to be a part of our amazing team of moderators, then we'd like to hear from you. Prior experience is a plus, but not the most important thing we're looking for. We want moderators who care about the topic of anxiety and the r/Anxiety community, fit well with our team, and want to help.

If this describes you, there are some steps below that we'd like you to take to apply. These steps include some open-ended questions that we'd like your thoughtful answers on. Everything else that you might need to know, we can help you learn along the way. If you're interested in moderating and want to get a head start on all there is to know, we recommend you [check out the Reddit training offered here.](https://redditforcommunity.com/)

# What are the expectations for users who join the r/Anxiety moderation team?

We need people who will engage and communicate about what they see and what questions they have. Our moderation team is supportive and understanding. We know you have a life outside of Reddit, and we expect you to put that life first. Sometimes that means you might have less time to moderate and that's okay. We expect communication and coordination so that we can support each other and bring in more help when we need to.

# Anything I should know before I apply?

Yes, [r/Anxiety](https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/) is a support community for anxiety and other related illnesses and we often encounter posts and comments that describe traumatic experiences or crisis. Some of this content can be disturbing.

Our team policy is that when a post or comment is too much for one of us to handle, we let the rest of the team know and someone else will step in to handle it, *but there is no way to eliminate the exposure completely*.

If you apply, please expect that we will ask you about your comfort level in moderating content of this nature and what strategies you might use to make sure your own mental health needs are met.

No one is expected to address issues that are uncomfortable for them, but you should expect to encounter such things if you join the team.

Second, we require that moderators join our Discord server, where we communicate and coordinate our moderation efforts. Part of the application process includes joining us on that server for a chat. You will need a Discord account (can be an existing account if you have one).

# How do I apply?

If you are interested in joining our team, here is the process we follow:

1. Send us a [modmail](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=r/anxiety) indicating that you are interested and include answers to the following questions:
   * What does mental health mean to you?
   * Why are you interested in being a moderator on r/Anxiety ?
   * In your opinion, what are some differences between a good moderator and a bad moderator?
2. We will review your [modmail](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=r/anxiety) and your application. If we find your answers satisfactory, we will send a form for you to fill out.
3. We will invite candidates we think might be a good fit to join us on our Discord server so we can interact and get to know each other before making a decision on extending an invitation to be a moderator.
4. New moderators on the r/Anxiety moderator team start out with a trial run that will last about three weeks. During that time, the trial moderator will have limited moderation responsibilities, both for evaluation and to help provide a structured way to get up to speed.

Thanks for reading, and we hope you apply!",Pi25,16,8,1740377437.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1iwvbzn/ranxiety_is_looking_for_new_moderators/,Positive,Low Concern,Reddit
1jrtgdf,Anxiety traveling abroad as a black immigrant under the current administration,"A friend and I have been planning a trip out of the country, but the insanity from the current administration detaining people under the guise of immigration enforcement is causing some immense anxiety. My friend is a black woman who is a naturalized US citizen, so she should be able to travel in and out of the country without having to worry about being detained, but the anxiety is still there because this administration doesn't seem to care about the law.

Has anybody (in particular, immigrants and/or people of color) traveled abroad and returned recently under the current administration? Can you share anything that may help ease my friend's anxiety on this? I am 100% ok with cancelling the trip to ease her anxiety, but she's been looking forward to this for so long and I would hate for it to be ruined by the orange asshole and his goons.",Left_Tradition8457,31,24,1743820695.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1jrtgdf/anxiety_traveling_abroad_as_a_black_immigrant/,Negative,Low Concern,US
1js3975,"I am done. Anxiety disorders have reduced my quality of life to miserable. Not homeless, got all 4 limbs BUT so what if I can't enjoy life regardless. CPTSD causing crushing bouts of prolonged severe anxiety turned out to be the last straw. BACK TO CLONAZEPAM (Klonopin).","Everyone either mention the two above, or having a family, or being able to get education...

...and I surely would appreciate, and DID appreciate life before...
...before repeated emotional trauma.
Additionally the exposure (a good non-pharm. coping/therapy method don't get me wrong!) was just a bit too far too soon and...messed me up even more.
I went through NINE semesters of med school 1.5 a year away from getting an M.D. title.
I broke down even more.

Alcohol makes my body feel poisoned, so I drowned my sorrows in benzos. Abused them.
Even though I MAY STILL GO BACK and FINISH...
I Broke down again, and again.

Started abusing both clonazepam and alprazolam but addiction to the latter for me was worse, because alprazolam (Xanax) lasts 4-5h and clonazepam (Klonopin Rivotril etc.) about 4 times as long.

My anxiety is all day-long and chronic but the trauma-related attacks of sheer panic are just soul crushing. Alprazolam won't do the trick because they can last for entire days.

I got diagnosed with ADHD in the meantime and by sheer miracle.
When I started failing med school due to anxiety making me a literal living mess, I got myself some Ritalin out of desperation for studying...kind of a forced ADHD diagnosis. A sin of mine that um paid off actually.

And thinking how it being a stimulant is basically the polar opposite of benzos these being CNS depressants or colloquially ""downers""...I was initially quite careful starting on 10mg.
Nothing.
Let's try 20mg said my doc a week after 10mg use.
""Ok"".

Dude. Helped my anxiety,
my depression,
my lack of energy and lethargic mindset,
 my boredom,
 my focus,
 my creativity...

Later down the line /a digresssion here/ it alleviated anxiety caused by XANAX WITHDRAWAL.
Then I paid attention and my strong black double Coffee slightly HELPS my anxiety too, unless I went further, but that's due to heart and BP obviously.

Took the tests, the funny simulated one, the questionare, evaluated by a psychologist/analyst...ADHD plain as day.

Later, my benzo habit got tapered, I got switched to Lyrica - pregabalin.
It worked wonders for generalized anxiety especially. 2 or 3 years and plop tolerance ruins all of it.
And 1200mg / 24h is no longer a medical dosing, and I get that.

Benzos got even more demonized than before but I had regretted so badly going overboard with them.

When Lyrica lost effectiveness...my main-line anxiolytic agent became...Ritalin. Or just methylphenidate as this was not the original formula.

I used twice as much methylphenidate as per doctors instructions.
When asked why - for anxiety, staggering the doses...since it fits with the dopamine fingers into my brain being a glove I could take 30mg instant release and go asleep.

But my new doc was kind enough to understand. Iost my will to seek new things educate myself make friends etc.
I'm 31. Sometimes I'm met with ""Ahh so young you shouldn't be taking such strong meds!""
When it comes to my own alley - that of mental anguish - that nearly drove me S. At worst point,
That caused me to become a chain smoker as first cig came a decade before getting Ritalin and never been able to quit - being at med school I got comments by my ""peers"", obviously,
and I may already be caring a mutation in my lower Airways up to 3 decades too soon...
...after my family members became distant as I'm a ""junkie"" if I plead for one medication that helps me function just-well-enough, and another that helps Save my sanity...

Doc gave me 2mg klonopin daily, dosed twice 1mg. Despite previous mistakes.
I'll never repeat them due to how much anguish this med can relieve. Never increase dose without asking psych doc. It's there and I already feel safer...
...which arrogant people will contribute to addiction despite having had a 3 year break, impossible physical aspect with mental diminished as if I F up and start abusing the med and chase that blasted dragon and eventually WILL have the med stopped forever - I wouldn't forgive myself

Currently 1mg - (5-6h) - 1mg considering clonazepam...

1. Pregabalin dropped from 1500mg daily to 900mg by using clonazepam for a week. Mind you, I'm V-E-R-Y dependent on this med. Goal is 600mg daily but at that point I'm fairly sure it won't work at all - and may quit altogether.

2. Methylphenidate (Ritalin) dropped from 108 mg [YEAH] (usually 40mg - 40mg - 28mg type deal immediate release 3h between doses).
Without propranolol additionally, (great nonaddictive med for somatic anxiety symptoms) hell my heart and BP would be too far...I wouldn't take it.
One week passed. From the average 108mg I went to 54mg daily taken in prolonged release formula.

So.
2mg of clonazepam dosed twice in 1mg doses for a week.

Results are,
1. Lyrica 1.5k mg /24h down by 600mg to 900mg
2. Ritalin used as per doctor's instruction. The abhorrent 108mg in spaced doses cut down by HALF into single 54mg XR formula. The Ritalin can now be used for ADHD proper and not handle ADHD AND anxiety disorders at once.

Hurr durr 2mg of clonazepam. Hurr durr BZD addict relapsing.


Humans and human life are too complicated to be put into 0 - 1ish labels of thinking.

My intention is by no means a glorification of clonazepam of benzos in general.

It's just that some people have less left to lose than meets the eye, and also, 5 years can give a lot to think through, mature, and maybe given how their lives are s*itty regardless and dose 2x max 24h medical max of two meds one no longer working another used off label due to necessity...

Well for me the effects are here. Once I go down to 600mg Lyrica daily so both meds are in medically allowed dose range..don't know.

The 2mg daily of clonazepam is 3 weeks tops but if things go messy and I start abusing another med, then clonazepam is back to action right away.



You don't have to suffer pointlessly.

1js45dp,SSRIs reality support and how to beat anxiety.,"I remember when I started taking the medication — I was only 17, dealing with anxiety and OCD. Like everyone else, I just wanted to feel ‘normal’ again, to feel like I did before, but that never really happened… until I started taking escitalopram.

The first two weeks were intense, but then I started feeling better — a bit of peace in my head. In the end, I was just a scared kid who wanted to feel okay. After a few months, things improved, and I started feeling normal. I felt calm and good, but also a bit numb and unmotivated, which is a side effect of the medication. You don’t feel bad, but you don’t feel great either — it dulls your emotions. But I didn’t care, I kept going.

Eventually, I reached a point where I thought I didn’t need it anymore, so I started tapering off. I stopped abruptly because I felt fine and wanted to feel that way without the pill. At first, I still felt okay — but no one had warned me about the withdrawal syndrome. Not even the doctor. That’s when I realized it had just been a patch for the anxiety, not a cure, and I started to understand things more clearly. Withdrawal syndrome usually causes a lot of anxiety and other symptoms. And for you that are here trying to try medication or that is passing the withdrawal symptoms. The problem is the doubt — not knowing whether it’s that or something else — may have affected. I recommend, as someone who has taken this pill, that you stop taking it and be strong. If millions have done it… you can too. Remember that pharmaceutical companies just want more money and to keep people medicated. It’s important that you understand this is just anxiety — which you already had even before taking the antidepressant. (Sorry for my English I speak Spanish)

There are people who are genuinely helped by it, no doubt, but they are much less than half, and that’s often because of the placebo effect. Doctors will tell you, “Yes, it’s definitely good to take medication, it’s a chemical imbalance in the brain,” but that’s not true! It’s really your overactive nervous system keeping you in fight-or-flight mode — as if there’s a lion in front of you that doesn’t exist, and your mind is trying to protect you from it. I recommend exercising, even if it’s hard. Stop searching on Reddit or Google. I’m here too because I’m also tapering off the medication, and I like to see how others are going through this hard time. But I’ve realized something: everyone seems to go through it in a similar way, and yet each of us has the ability to educate ourselves and face our own mind. It’s crucial to understand that this is temporary and requires a lot of patience, and to not stop doing what you truly want to do — as long as it’s something positive.

Ask any psychiatrist or psychologist if they’ve ever cured a patient, and most likely they won’t know how to answer — because anxiety, OCD, and depression aren’t cured with pills. Medication treats the symptoms, not the cause. And if there’s no apparent cause, it’s probably your thoughts — the ones you give too much value and importance to.

I’ll never forget the time I thought, “What if I hurt someone I love?” (an OCD thought). That mental trap — validating whether I was really capable of doing that — terrified me, and I started avoiding the thoughts. But that’s the real problem: avoiding them because of that mental trap. And believe it or not, everyone has those thoughts — they just don’t give them importance.

In the end, it’s all up to you — not a pill or a therapist. It sounds rough, but it’s possible. Instead of reading things on Reddit, look for stories of how people recovered from anxiety and how they faced it. Those Reddit posts are often written by people lying in bed, full of anxiety, doing nothing to get out of it — just waiting for the medicine to kick in or for something to magically change, but that doesn’t work. What works is being active, doing things you know are good for you — over and over again. It’s like taking your brain to the gym. You have to train it, and it’s rare to see immediate results at first. It takes time. The best thing is to accept where you are, stop fighting your mind (because that only makes it worse), and understand it. Understand that it’s just on high alert — and just like you entered this, you can get out of it.

I love you because I understand you, and we’re all going to get through this. ALL of us. God bless you.”",Beautiful_Opening_11,2,2,1743861771.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1js45dp/ssris_reality_support_and_how_to_beat_anxiety/,Positive,Moderate Concern,Reddit
