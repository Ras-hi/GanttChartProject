1gd9l9c,Elections and Politics,"Hello friends!

It's that time of the year again. We have always intended for r/mentalhealth to be a safe, politically neutral space for users, and we wish to keep it that way. We will be removing and locking threads that go out of hand with the political aspects of things.

Political anxiety is more common than you think around election time. If you are having trouble with political anxiety, there are ways to cope with the stress. Here are a few examples:

**Timeout**: Social media, including the news channels, are designed to have a negative tilt to collect views. They want you to keep coming back for more. It is an excellent idea to differentiate between thoughtful and stress-inducing, sensationalized material. It is okay to find out about news after it breaks. By waiting for accurate information and thoughtful analyses, you will be able to provide informative content for yourself. Limiting the use of social media to once or twice a day will be beneficial. If your political anxiety is still too much to handle, it might be time to take an extended break.

**Control**: The majority of what is happening in national and global politics is out of our personal control. Turning our attention to ourselves, our friends, families, and local communities can help us be empowered and productive. Engaging in activities you enjoy, such as hobbies, exercise, and time with friends, can be a healthy distraction. Practicing self-care through wellness techniques and programs can also help keep your anxiety in check. Here are some websites that provide helpful information and tips on self-care:

[MHA: Taking Good Care of Yourself](https://mhanational.org/taking-good-care-yourself)

[NHS: Self-Help Therapies](https://www.nhs.uk/mental-health/talking-therapies-medicine-treatments/talking-therapies-and-counselling/self-help-therapies/)

[El Camino Health: Emotional Self Care](https://www.elcaminohealth.org/community/chinese-health-initiative/specialty-programs/emotional-well-being/emotional-self-care)

**Community**: Connect with individuals who provide a safe space for understanding current events. Sharing what you are thinking and feeling with trusted peers can mitigate the negative effects of stress.

**Engage**: The feeling of helplessness can be stressful and discouraging. Getting involved with a local political party, volunteering with a community group, or participating in activism can help you feel a sense of accomplishment, power, and purpose. These activities also connect communities of like-minded people, which helps to alleviate stress.

**If you are experiencing a crisis or medical emergency, please contact your local emergency services. We have a** [list of resources](https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/wiki/index/resources/) **on our sidebar as well as a link to a** [global index](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_suicide_crisis_lines) **of emergency numbers.**

1e297nd,r/MentalHealth is looking for moderators,"Hey r/mentalhealth! We're looking to grow our moderation team. Moderators are a key part of what makes any reddit community special. If you are interested in helping to make this community special, we'd like to talk to you.

# What do the mods do?

Moderators here on mentalhealth work to build our community and make this a safe place to discuss the many facets of mental health and the ways that mental health and mental wellness influence daily life. Moderators help to write the rules, respond to content concerns, set policies, update community themes and appearance, manage automation, and general upkeep.

# What are the minimum requirements to apply? Can I apply if I've never been a moderator before?

If you care about mental health and would like to be a part of our amazing team of moderators, then we'd like to hear from you. Prior experience is a plus, but not the most important thing we're looking for. We want moderators who care about mental health and the r/mentalhealth community, fit well with our team, and want to help.

If this describes you there are some steps below that we'd like you to take to apply. These steps include some open ended questions that we'd like your thoughtful answers on. Everything else that you might need to know we can help you learn along the way. If you're interested in moderating and want to get a head start on all there is to know, we recommend you [check out the reddit training offered here.](https://redditforcommunity.com)

# What are the expectations for moderators who join the r/mentalhealth mod team?

Mod team members need to be a part of the team. We need people who will engage and communicate about what they see and what questions they have. Our mod team is supportive and understanding. We know you have a life outside of reddit, and we expect you to put that life first. Sometimes that means you might have less time to moderate and that's okay. We expect communication and coordination so that we can support each other and bring in more help when we need to.

# Is there anything I should know about moderating r/mentalhealth before I apply?

Yes. r/mentalhealth is a support community for mental health and we often encounter posts and comments that describe traumatic experiences or crisis. Some of this content can be disturbing.

Our team policy is that when a post or comment is too much for one of us to handle, we let the rest of the team know and someone else will step in to handle it, *but there is no way to eliminate the exposure completely*.

If you apply, please expect that we will ask you about your comfort level in moderating content of this nature and what strategies you might use to make sure your own mental health needs are met.

No one is expected to address issues that are uncomfortable for them, but you should expect to encounter such things if you join the team.

Second, we require that moderators join our discord server, where we communicate and coordinate our moderation efforts. Part of the application process includes joining us on that server for a chat. You will need a discord account (can be an existing account if you have one).

# How do I apply?

If you are interested in joining our team, here is the process we follow:

1. Send us a modmail indicating that you are interested and include answers to the following questions:
   * What does mental health mean to you?
   * Why are you interested in being a moderator on r/mentalhealth?
   * In your opinion, what are some differences between a good moderator and a bad moderator?
2. We will review your modmail and your application. We may ask for some additional information about your moderation experience and how familiar you are with reddit. We may use a google form to structure those questions.
3. We will invite candidates we think might be a good fit to join us on our discord server so we can interact and get to know each other before making a decision on extending an invitation to be a moderator.
4. New moderators on the r/mentalhealth moderator team start out with a trial run that will last about four weeks. During that time, the trial moderator will have limited moderation responsibilities, both for evaluation and to help provide a structured way to get up to speed.

Thanks for reading, and we hope you apply!",DrivesInCircles,21,27,1720873558.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1e297nd/rmentalhealth_is_looking_for_moderators/,Positive,Low Concern
1js4848,I chose not to die. I left loaded weapons on the table and walked to the hospital.,"I’m 38. I’ve been sober since 2018, married with a child, and on paper I’m doing well—career, family, stability. But inside, I’ve spent years quietly falling apart.

My first serious crash was at 22. I had gotten a girl pregnant, and before we could talk about it, she had an abortion without telling me. That destroyed me. I fell into a depression I couldn’t explain to anyone. I stopped going to class. I isolated. I drank. A lot.

One night, drunk and desperate, I emptied my bank account ($3,000) and bought a one-way Greyhound ticket to L.A. I never made it—I got robbed at the terminal, then arrested. The cops took me to a psych ward instead of jail. That might have saved my life.

Eventually I finished college. In 2011 I worked in Afghanistan with the military. We got hit with rocket attacks regularly, but I barely reacted. I wasn’t brave—I was numb. Nothing outside felt as intense as what was happening inside me.

At 27, I lost my job and ended up hospitalized again after another depressive spiral. The suicidal ideation had become familiar by that point. It would creep in and take over until I couldn’t tell if I was in danger or just tired of existing.

I didn’t stop drinking until I was 33. One morning, I left for the hospital with loaded weapons sitting on my coffee table. I made a choice not to die that day—and I’ve never forgotten it.

A doctor told me I had cirrhosis. That scared me sober. A year later, a liver specialist told me it was alcoholic hepatitis and that I’d recovered. Somehow, my body gave me a second chance.

Since then, I’ve stayed sober. I’ve been diagnosed with Major Depressive Disorder, and I’ve tried different meds. Some helped. Some triggered what I can only describe as months of euphoria. I spent thousands of dollars on Pokémon cards. I told myself it was “investing,” but really, I was spinning out.

When I crashed again, I ended up in the hospital for a week. The idea of bipolar has been brought up, but nothing formal. I don’t know what I am—other than confused.

Now, even with meds and sobriety, I’ve started raging at the smallest criticisms. It’s like this explosive anger just erupts from nowhere. I hate how it makes me feel. I hate the way it affects my wife and kid. I want to stop, but I don’t fully understand what’s happening inside me.

I’m doing everything I can. Therapy. Psychiatry. Meds. Honest reflection. And still—some days I feel like I’m right back on the edge I was at 10 years ago.

I guess I’m writing this because I needed to say it out loud. I don’t have a clean ending or an insight to offer. Just this:

I’m still here. Still trying.",Ateepeemadeofpeepee,88,18,1743861991.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1js4848/i_chose_not_to_die_i_left_loaded_weapons_on_the/,Negative,Moderate Concern
1js16z6,"Why is BPD excusatory, but narcissism is accusatory?","I would have posted this in r/AskReddit but I couldn't write more than the title.

Basically... why? I know a few people with BPD, and one of them (ex friend) used it as an excuse for shitty behavior like cancelling plans she insisted in make with me, with no regard of my time (I had a job and little free time) and no *""I'm sorry for being such an asshole""*. To be fair most people I know with BPD are working towards self-improvement and being functional beings of society, but in the case of that girl, she used it as an excuse AND also her mother, who stopped talking to me because ""she understand what her daughter has, and she loves her the way she is"" (basically spoiling her).

But on the other hand, narcissism is an accusatory term. r/raisedbynarcissists or r/NarcissisticAbuse for example. But both narcissism and BPD are clinical terms, they are cluster B diagnosis. But **no one would say** ***""You have to empathise with me and excuse me for my behavior, I have narcissistic personality disorder""*****.** But many people with BPD say this. As if people with BPD can't control their actions but narcissistics are machiavelic or something.

If I tell you the issue with that former friend without mentioning her disorder, many will tell me *""She is a narcissist! Screw her!""*. But if I mention she has BPD, so so so many people from TikTok and self-diagnosed with some disorder will say *""You gotta understand her, she has a disorder that messes up her personality, you have to support her, she doesn't want to be like this""*. WHY? Narcissism is still a disorder (not just being evil). BPD still has awful consequences on the mental and emotional health of your close people. **Just because you have a diagnosed mental disorder doesn't mean you can get away with being insensitive and emotionally irresponsible:** others have their feelings, their problems and even their mental disorders (hello, depression and anxiety!).

TL;DR: narcissism is a disorder that requires treatment (not just being evil), and BPD is not an excuse for shitty behavior and getting away with it.",sleepyncaffeinated,15,25,1743851904.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1js16z6/why_is_bpd_excusatory_but_narcissism_is_accusatory/,Negative,Moderate Concern
1jrpkb0,"Is it just me, or is everyone’s mental health declining lately?","I’m 23, and I always thought my mental health struggles were just a result of entering adulthood—more responsibilities, transitioning from student life, trying to figure out who I am, etc. But lately, I’ve been noticing something deeper going on—not just with me, but with everyone around me.

I keep reading about 15 and 16-year-olds suffering from brain fog, anxiety, depression, even suicidal thoughts. That terrifies me. These are kids. What’s happening to us?

Is it really just social media messing with our brains? Is it COVID and the long-term psychological or even physical effects? Is it the state of the world—economically, socially, environmentally? Or are we just becoming more aware of mental health issues that always existed?

I know part of it is the overwhelming amount of technology in our lives—how it’s created this weird paradox where we’re constantly connected but feel more isolated than ever. It’s like we’re surrounded by people online but starved for real connection in real life.

I mean, I’m sure if you were living 200 years ago, these things didn’t exist, right? Or at least not at this scale. People weren’t constantly anxious, mentally burnt out, or numb at 16. What the hell is going on?

I don’t know. It just feels like something is off with this entire generation. Like we’re all slowly slipping. I’d love to hear your thoughts—do you feel the same? Do you think there’s a bigger reason behind this mental health crisis?

1js6g41,Bad feelings aren't facts (i fought depression -> gives me HOPE anyone can too),"When I was clinically depressed, one of the most terrifying things was believing every negative thought my mind told me; 

>""you're a burden""  
""you'll never get better""  
""everyone else has it figured out""

It felt very real in the moment but it wasn't true (i learned that later) 

One of the biggest insights that helped me was: **Every bad feeling we have is often the result of our distorted negative thinking.** Learned this through therapy (CBT) and from the book *""Feeling Good""* by Dr. David Burns

One tool mentioned in the book that helped me the MOST was the '**Triple Column Technique**':  
You write down your:

**1. Automatic Thought** (negative thought that came to you)  
**2. Cognitive Distortion** (like all-or-nothing thinking, overgeneralization, mind reading, etc.)  
**3. Positive Rational Response**

**Example:**

>**Thought:** ""Everyone else is moving ahead, and I’m being left behind.""  
**Distortions:** Mental Filter, Catastrophizing, Fortune Telling  
**Rational Response:** ""I’m on my own path 🛤️. Life isn’t a race, and growth doesn’t follow a single timeline.""

  
Doing this was hard initially because it takes effort to come up w positive rationale but what helps is seeing more and more examples of it (mentioned in the book, you can also ask ChatGPT for examples, i'll also mention some in a doc in comment you can check it out)   
  
Regularly doing it made me realize **how harshly I have been talking to myself and that most of it wasn’t even true**.   
**Another major shift for me was learning self-compassion:**  
I didn’t have to ""earn"" kindness by achieving something first.  
You don't need permission to treat yourself kindly — you just do it.  
  
**If you're silently struggling right now:**  
I just want you to know that **times do change** and we are in a tunnel vision when depression is elevated but there's ALWAYS LIGHT AT THE END OF THE TUNNEL (you just can't see it yet)   
and i heard it when i was depressed, it didnt mean anything in that moment but as time passed by i was able to show myself good things are happening and maybe things can change -> that helped w positive compounding. Keep going :)

1js1hjj,I hate myself.,"Body image issues, questioning self worth and burned out!!

I’m really hating myself lately. I’ve been struggling with major body image issues due to PCOS, and no matter how much I try, I can’t seem to overcome them. It’s like this constant war in my head that I've been losing 

I feel like everyone secretly hates me. I’ve been losing friends recently, and it’s made me wonder if something is inherently wrong with me. I have social anxiety, so I tend to behave awkwardly in some situations,sometimes I might come off as rude, but I never mean to hurt anyone. my friends know that, but still, I feel misunderstood and distant.
The way things are going, I’m scared I might slip into depression. And on top of all this, I’m a medical student. The pressure and the academics have really taken a toll on me. I keep wondering  am I even good enough?

I just had a breakdown. I feel like no one really understands what I’m going through. I’m not emotionally close to my family either, which makes things harder .sometimes I wish someone could just tell me what to eat, what to wear, what to do!!(everything that Fleabag said). 
I’m tired. Mentally drained. I shut down often, going into a kind of functional freeze. I want to get better, I really do, but I don’t know how. I don’t know where to start. I just… need help.

I have been seeing things like shadows, items that when I try touching them they disappear, random black bugs crawling around but when I turn to look at them they're not there.

I have been hearing my name being called at random times of day especially when I'm at school when no one's talking to me and random people laughing. 

All of the things mentioned above are just brief moments, and they have been happening for at least a year now. Also when these happen, I don't think im in a paranoid state nor am I worried about anything,

Recently, I've also been experiencing nightmares involving everyone I've ever loved leaving me or getting possessed, or just anything disturbing happening to them. My memories have also gotten foggier (I'm not sure if that's a word) and harder to remember, I've also seem to have gotten stupider.

My parents took me to a psychiatrist a year ago and they diagnosed me with bipolar disorder, they gave me meds for it (I don't take them anymore since they don't help) I don't think it's very much accurate because I don't think I have ever experienced a manic episode in my life. Recently my mom took me to a therapist and she told me that I might have asymptomatic depression, so I'm not sure if that contributes to what I'm experiencing rn

1js6ams,A short poem I made about mental health relapse,"Mental health relapse

It starts with irritability at the smallest of things

As paranoia settles in and rakes your brain

You become reclusive shutting out your most precious of things

Your hands become clammy as reality sinks in 

Dreams and hopes spewed down a drain 

That has no end, pain on replay

 You cast a lazy look at your pills on display

Even lifting a hand is more than a pain

 Invisible to the naked eye

 Ignorant to the majority 

Depression sets in and oppresses the minority

All things you loved to play with Thrown aside at a pew 

You retreat to a God you subconsciously always knew

 In the form of the devil chasing after you 

You retreat into your shadow a growing curfew 

Your form breaks in habits forming dank mildew

Without even knowing your cognitive screams self-awareness at you

Unknowingly knowing you stare right through 

On deaf ears without an escape A quagmire of truths 

Your illness presents its self as firm as self-doubt

 Mental health relapses without a doubt

1js68oy,Need help in dealing with SEVERE social anxiety:(,"making this as short as I can, I have disfigurement due to a disease I have, I tend to hide my face with my hair which does the job for the most part, but i truly believe i’m the ugliest most hideous looking woman on this earth and that everyone who would see my true self would be disgusted.. hence i believe i don’t deserve anything good in life.
All this have caused me to develop severe social anxiety, I feel like i’m undeserving of even talking to people which makes my whole major (medicine) difficult to complete. I also have alot of serious health concerns, but i’ve never seeked help. I’m even so fucking anxious to see a doctor, even though i work with them all the time. I can’t begin to explain how i’ve pushed thinking or dealing with anything in my life, starting with health, my studies, working on myself, my social life, my non existent love life,,, the way i deal with everything is by complete ignorance, and idk brain rotting the whole day.. 
As seeking medical help is difficult itself, you can conclude that getting therapy would even be a bigger challenge.. 
I’m tired of living this life, and i feel like if i get slightly better with the social anxiety aspect of my fucked up life, perhaps I could start facing everything else that i’ve been pushing away..

1js68aq,My parents are angry at me,"So, my parents have been mad at me lately because I told them I feel uncomfortable and unsafe around them—that’s why I don’t talk to them or ask for help. Every time I open up about how I feel, they either get angry, deeply offended, or start yelling. Sometimes they even give me the silent treatment or start a huge fight. They always say I’ve hurt them, but I never meant to.

For context, I had a really rough relationship with them growing up—lots of yelling, fear, constant fights, and anxiety. I don’t even remember my childhood clearly.

Anyway, it all started again when I went out with my mom. I was quiet and clearly stressed, and she got upset. She started yelling, pinched me (which hurt a bit), and called me mentally ill and depressed like it was something to be ashamed of. She kept shouting all the way home, calling me insane and other names, after all them my dad was upset for how I made my mum feel and told him how I actually feel all the time about them .

1js5vkl,My dad died a few months ago and my bf broke up with me cause I was sad about it? (a random diary entry to make myself feel better),"I want to touch on - how to deal with grief, not just in terms of losing someone you love but also grieving on a life you thought you would live. Once you realise that this is not the plan for you, how do you deal with letting go of that and facing the unknown and feeling scared and disappointed.

Also want to touch on the full body experience that is a breakup. It’s honestly something that should be studied more the phases of who you become and your behaviour when you are leaving someone you once loved. Facing the reality is the situation and choosing yourself. Knowing that you are amazing and loved and valuable and perfect and enough just as you are, you don’t have to perform for anyone to be loved. You at your rawest and your saddest and your happiest is enough. 

The heart ache that comes with letting go and the relief you feel when the show is over. The constant need to perform has ended. The cameras have stopped, the curtains are closed, you can breathe now. Fully. Deeply. 

And beyond romantic breakups I think the hardest thing to deal with are friendship break ups - I put so much value in my friends and what they do for me that when I feel a friendship fading it hurts. Especially when that becomes reality and you stop getting invited to places and stop getting told things about them and their life and you slowly feel yourself becoming strangers. Someone you’ve cried in their arms before, someone you shared meals with, a bed with, outfits, makeup - magic Zara outfit. It’s such a painful thing to have to go through. 

When life gives you lemons, you surely must make lemonade. Start by trusting that god does not burden you with more than you can bear. Anything you are going through, you are going through it because you are strong enough to overcome it. It may not seem like it now, but you are. And everything you are going through is a part of gods plan. And god is the best of planners. 

If there is anything guaranteed that we as humans will experience it is: love and loss and change. So we should never love without the possibility of losing and we should never be against the thought of change. 

I think a lot of the time the tension, sadness and the depression comes from the inability to accept reality and accept that this is what it is now. When you are fighting with your life and saying why me, why now, what did I do wrong, where did I go wrong, what if I did this different or never said xzy, it’s puts pressure on yourself and the illusion that you had the power to control the outcome of the situation. Whether you said or you didn’t say. you went or you didn’t go, if it was meant to happen, it was going to happen independent of your actions. If you broke up with your bf it’s because you were never meant to be together,  if you’re friendship has ended it means they were meant to help you in that chapter of your life, not be protagonists in your whole story. 

And you have to let go of what you hoped would be the desired outcome.

1js1dg9,My mental health has plummeted over the last few months and I don’t know what to do anymore…,"I just need to vent. 23F and my mental health is in shambles. I have diagnosed clinical depression and anxiety issues for which I have been in therapy for and on medication for the last couple years. 
I wake up on most days feeling absolutely demoralised and demotivated, with no purpose or idea how to go about picking up the pieces of what is left of my life. 
I lost my dad, my superhero, just about 5 months ago and my entire world came crumbling down soon after. For anyone who has experienced parental loss, I’m sorry. My heart goes out to you. It’s one thing losing a parent, it’s another when you just keep slipping further down in the aftermath. 
I come from a relatively upper-middle class upbringing, and from some family money. My father started a business a couple years ago, where my mom and elder brother also work. I did too, until I lost dad and now I can’t bear to go into the office because it’s insufferable. Every time I walk past his cabin- lights out and smelling damp- it reminds me of a better time that was, when I was happy. I’m not happy anymore. 
In the months following my fathers very unexpected passing away, we have not only lost almost all our money (settling a shitload of debt my dad left behind that he was trying to sort out for a while now), but are also on the brink of losing our company and home. I was used to a life where I had the liberty of following my life’s passion without worrying much about the more nuanced things like groceries and bills. Since dad, all that has changed. 
To make matters more complicated, in a fit of trying to gain back control or I don’t know what, I cheated on my angel of a boyfriend of 3 years. He has honestly been the most supportive presence in my life and I hate myself everyday for what I did. Living with this guilt has become insufferable. While he has forgiven me, we are no longer together. He’s still very much a part of my life but I know the possibility of him leaving is so wide open that it keeps me up in the middle of the night. 
I have lost my appetite, I can’t sleep anymore. My eating disorder is at an all time high (I’m bulimic) and nothing is more torturous than having to get out of bed in the morning. I worry. All the time and about everything. 
I have tried to end myself too, resulting in a hospitalisation that has left me feeling even more like a failure and a liability. 
I have also recently figured out (with the help of my ex-boyfriend) that I’m a compulsive liar. I never consciously recognised this trait up until now. It has come to my attention that this trait has potential of ruining my life even more than it is now but I don’t know what to do about it. 
My therapist for the last 4 years has decided to move away and I do not have the energy or courage to go around on another hunt to find someone else. 
Life is throwing me curveball after another and I’m afraid I’ve run out of patience. Everyone I speak to keeps telling me it will take time for things to settle down and that I need to be there for my mom and brother too but I can’t seem to muster up the courage to go through anything anymore. I just want my old life back. I used to have a family, a boyfriend who adored me, friends who supported me and a career that was doing well. I now have nothing. And I just don’t know what to do anymore. How to start living again. I just don’t know… ",Upstairs-District366,2,4,1743852603.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1js1dg9/my_mental_health_has_plummeted_over_the_last_few/,Positive,Moderate Concern

She’s a 16 (so am I) but idk if being a minor changes anything but if it does then please let me know cause google just gives me long paragraphs abt nothing I’m looking for. 

Here are my main questions. 

TIME WINDOW/PERIOD? 
What’s the usually time window someone’s there? She didn’t try and harm herself she just has horrible mental health and her therapist is why she’s going. She is a minor if that changes anything. 

CONTACT?
Any way to visit or contact her at all? She called me before her phone got taken by the hospital and she said she has my number written down but that’s all I know. 

Here’s a question that I don’t really mind if people know or not but everything helps! 

WITHDRAWS?
She smokes nicotine and weed and I was wondering if they did anything? Obv not handing her a cigarette and a lighter but do they give any medicine to calm them down? Her withdrawals are gonna be hell for her and I feel horrible. 



She still isn’t admitted yet I think, idk cause we have no contact, but if she’s not admitted and I get confirmation and all that I will be sure to add it to this post. Thanks to everyone who took their time to read this and if anyone knows ANYTHING, doesent have to be anything i asked but ANYTHING please let me know, I want all the info about this place as I can get, Thanks you. stay strong and I love y’all! ❤️❤️

1js5c2f,How to make friends.?,"Life sucks man.

I am literally all alone 30M. My only contact with other people are my 2 children and the ten coworkers I have. They've made it very clear that they don't like me. Which I understand I'm hard to get along with I suppose. 

But I also have no help with my children because of this other than their mother. She will do the bare minimum for me and then hold it against me, so I want to become independent from her totally. Here's where making friends come in...

It's extremely hard for me to trust people due to trauma and mental illness. The paranoia gives me even more distrust, and then more so when the paranoid thought was correct. Kind of a cycle, more paranoid thoughts are proven true than my happy thoughts, so I trust a little less each time. To the point I'm considering whether I'm a sociopath or not.

Recently, my Medicaid was dropped and I can no longer afford healthcare at all. Definitely can't afford $60 a week for therapy.

Anyway, all this coupled with some social anxiety at times makes it impossible for me to randomly approach people and anhedonia is making it hard to find something to connect to others with. Where or how do I start?

I cannot follow a religion or act like I can just for help.

1js49c4,"Anyone else hate the idea that mental illness is ""because you're not trying hard enough""?","I'm not going to deny the fact that putting in effort helps mental health. It definitely does - good sleep, nutrition, hydration, exercise, routine, doing things you love, socializing absolutely helps your mental health. Focusing on the good parts of your life, not letting the negative parts of your day consume your head, reframing thought patterns, practicing gratitude definitely help. I'm not saying these aren't useful, and they have helped me somewhat improve from before. I was fully self-loathing, incredibly socially anxious to the point of almost being mute, addicted, agoraphobic, and unmotivated, and a lot of these problems are gone or lessened due to me trying hard to help myself.

But I absolutely hate the idea that I hear from others all around me, that if I appreciated the good in my life a little harder, or woke up at 5am and was productive all day, or meditated more often, or tried to think positively even harder, or just tried even more, I wouldn't be suffering so much. *And it's just not that simple!* And it sucks even more because I feel like I put in a lot more effort functioning than other people do - for me, waking up in the morning and getting out of bed and eating and sleeping and drinking and moving can be difficult, and even just deciding I want to live was the hardest decision I've ever made. It feels like all that effort goes unnoticed by everyone around me, and this is made even worse by the idea that you should ""just pull yourself up"" or ""try harder"".

1js3y9f,"I trust my boyfriend, but I can’t stop overthinking when he’s out drinking with coworkers.","TL;DR:
My boyfriend and I have been together for 6 years. He's not much of a drinker, but his job involves frequent celebrations and trips where drinking is common. Lately, I’ve been overwhelmed with anxiety whenever he goes out with colleagues, especially when he drinks or stays out late. I’ve tried hobbies, socializing, and even therapy, but the overthinking and fear of being replaced won’t go away. I don’t want to be a burden, but I’m struggling and don’t know what to do anymore.

We've been together since college, and we're both working now. I work from home, while he’s office-based. His company often holds celebrations, most of which involve drinking. During their slack season, he and his co-workers usually plan trips that last for days—and of course, there’s drinking involved.

My boyfriend isn’t really a drinker. He doesn’t always agree to go when his colleagues invite him out for drinks. I don’t want to stop him from having fun.

We’ve been together for six years now, but this is the first time I’ve ever felt this way—overthinking when he’s out drinking and spending time with colleagues. I already talked to him about it, but I feel like he misunderstood me. He said he always tries to understand me but he doesn’t know what to do anymore. What if he gets tired of me?

I even pleaded with him to promise he wouldn’t get too drunk. He did promise, but I worry that his co-workers are pushy and might pressure him into drinking more than he wants.

What do you think I should do?  
I’ve tried finding new hobbies. I’ve gone out with friends more often. I even tried talking to a psychologist. But none of it has helped. My anxiety is still there.

Whenever I share my worries with my boyfriend, I end up feeling guilty. I feel sad, and I always think that I’m just making things harder for him.

I overthink everything now—even the times he doesn’t reply. I wasn’t like this before. I don’t know what changed in me.

I keep thinking something bad might happen to him. Or that other women might approach him. I wonder what he’s like when he’s drunk. I can’t help but feel like I’m easily replaceable. His co-workers are professionals—maybe they understand him better than I do. I find myself feeling jealous of anyone now. I don’t want to be like this. I don’t want to be a burden to him. Just the thought of him partying, getting drunk, is just so heavy for me. I don’t know why. Maybe because I just wasn’t exposed in that kind of environment.

I really need help. I don’t know what to do anymore. There are days when I can’t even get out of bed because I keep thinking about these things all day. Especially now—there’s another company celebration coming up. He told me he’ll be drinking and will stay out until 3 AM.

Do you think going to his apartment and waiting for him until he comes home might help ease my anxiety? Do you think that might help solve this?

Please be kind with your response. I already feel guilty enough. I’ve blamed myself enough.",whyyyme_,1,8,1743861194.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1js3y9f/i_trust_my_boyfriend_but_i_cant_stop_overthinking/,Positive,Moderate Concern

doqwow,"Our most-broken and least-understood rules is ""helpers may not invite private contact as a first resort"", so we've made a new wiki to explain it","We understand that most people who reply immediately to an OP with an invitation to talk privately  mean only to help, but this type of response usually leads to either disappointment or disaster.  it usually works out quite differently here than when you say ""PM me anytime"" in a casual social context.  

We have huge admiration and appreciation for the goodwill and good citizenship of so many of you who support others here and flag inappropriate content - even more so because we know that so many of you are struggling yourselves.  We're hard at work behind the scenes on more information and resources to make it easier to give and get quality help here - this is just a small start.  

Our new wiki page explains in detail why it's much better to respond in public comments, at least until you've gotten to know someone.  It will be maintained at /r/depression/wiki/private_contact, and the full text of the current version is below.

*****

###Summary###

**Anyone who, while acting as a helper, invites or accepts private contact (I.e. PMs, chat, or any kind of offsite communication) early in the conversion is showing either bad intentions or bad judgement.  Either way, it's unwise to trust them.** 


""PM me anytime"" seems like a kind and generous offer. And it might be perfectly well-meaning, but, unless and until a solid rapport has been established, it's just not a wise idea.  Here are some points to consider before you offer or accept an invitation to communicate privately.

* **By posting supportive replies publicly, you'll help more people than just the OP. If your responses are of good quality, you'll educate and inspire other helpers.** [The 1-9-90 rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1%25_rule_(Internet_culture\)) applies here as much as it does anywhere else on the internet.  

* People who are struggling with serious mental-health issues often (justifiably) have a low tolerance for disappointment and a high-level of ever-changing emotional need. **Unless the helper is able to make a 100% commitment to be there for them in every way, for as long as necessary, offering a personal inbox as a resource is likely to do more harm than good.** This is why mental-health crisis-line responders usually don't give their names and callers aren't allowed to request specific responders.  It's much healthier and safer for the callers to develop a relationship with the agency as a whole.  Analogously, it's much safer and healthier for our OPs to develop a relationship with the community as a whole.  Even trained responders are generally not allowed to work high-intensity situations alone.  It's partly about availability, but it's mostly about wider perspective and preventing compassion fatigue. 

* **If a helper gets in over their head with someone whose mental-health issues (including suicidality, which is often comorbid with depression) escalate, in a PM conversation it's much harder for others, including the /r/depression and /r/SuicideWatch moderators to help**.  (Contrary to common assumptions, moderators can't see or police PMs.)  

* In our observation over many years, the people who say ""PM me"" the most are consistently the ones with the least understanding of mental-health issues and mental-health support. We all have gaps in our knowledge and in our ability to communicate effectively.  Community input mitigates these limitations. **There's no reason why someone who's truly here to help would want to hide their responses from community scrutiny**.  If helpers are concerned about their own privacy, keep in mind that self-disclosure, when used supportively, is more about the feelings than the details, and that we have no problem here with the use of alt/throwaway accounts, and have no restrictions on account age or karma.  

*  We all know the internet is used by some people to exploit or abuse others.  These people *do* want to hide their deceptive and manipulative responses from everyone except their victims. There are many of them who specifically target those who are vulnerable because of mental-health issues. **If a helper invites an OP to talk privately and gives them a good, supportive experience, they've primed that person to be more vulnerable to abusers.** This sort of cognitive priming tends to be particularly effective when someone's in a state of mental-health crisis, when people rely more on heuristics than critical reasoning.

* If OPs want to talk privately, posting on a wide-open anonymous forum like reddit might not be the best option. Although we don't recommend it, we do allow OPs to request private contact when asking for support. If you want to do this, please keep your expectations realistic, and to have a careful look at the history of anyone who offers to PM before opening up to them.",SQLwitch,2361,177,1572360722.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/doqwow/our_mostbroken_and_leastunderstood_rules_is/,Positive,High Risk
1frqlk0,"Regular check-in post, with information about our rules and wikis","Welcome to /r/depression's check-in post - a place to take a moment and share what is going on and how you are doing. If you have an accomplishment you want to talk about (these shouldn't be standalone posts in the sub as they violate the ""role model"" rule, but are permitted here), or are having a tough time but prefer not to make your own post, this is a place you can share.

-----

Our subreddit rules are located in the sidebar (you can also always access them at https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/about/rules) - since all of them exist for important safety reasons, we ask everyone here to read and follow them. Please click 'report' on any harmful content you see here - we always want to know and deal as soon as we can.

We also have several wikis there for help with finding and giving support:

https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/wiki/what_is_depression provides guidance about what is and isn't a depressive disorder, guidance on the complex nature of the illnesses that are usually grouped under the ""depression"" label, and redirect information for common off-topic issues.

https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/wiki/giving_help offers information on the nature and value of peer support for mental-health issues in general, and lots of guidance for learning what is -- and isn't -- usually helpful in giving peer support.

YSK that the types of rule violations that we most frequently see interfering with people getting safe and relevant support here are:

- People breaking the private contact rule. You should never trust anyone who tries to get you into a private conversation in response to a post here. See https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/wiki/private_contact

- ""I'm here to help"" posts. This shows that you don't understand the most basic principles of peer support, especially selectivity. The ""giving help"" wiki explains more about this.

- Role modelling, i.e. ""achievement"" or ""advice"" posts. This is an expert-free zone -- that's what peer support means (rule 5). We know that ""internet culture"" celebrate not just bragging about your achievements but bragging about your good intentions. Nothing like that is ever acceptable here.

- Content that's more about 'making a statement' or casually polling the sub than seeking personal support (or, in a comment, giving it) (rules 1, 2 and 10).

- Off-topic posts about difficult situations or circumstances, including interpersonal losses. Grief, sadness, anger, and other difficult emotions are not mental illnesses. The ""what is depression"" wiki has suggestions for other places to post about these issues, which are 100% valid and serious but inappropriate here.",SQLwitch,44,268,1727564743.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1frqlk0/regular_checkin_post_with_information_about_our/,Positive,Moderate Concern

1js5py6,struggles with depression,"Hey everyone, just thought I'd share a bit, and ask for some support, it would be greatly appreciated.

I don't know why, or how it started, I was your average 9 year old (17 now) kid, living life as one should. I never really asked to be like this, I had hopes and dreams for the future, I wanted to be someone great someday, but, as I stand near the edge of adult-hood and freedom, I look back and scared. I don't want to deal with life, I don't want to have people in my life that I'll eventually drag into my depression, I never want to hurt anyone again. I've hurt enough people already, and to be honest, I never meant to. I just try to be happy and a good guy, but its near impossible for me to change. Therapy barely works, my new anti-depressants and sleep schedule fuck with me constantly, I just want to be left alone, I don't want to interact with people, because if I do, I'll end up hurting them, yet at the same time, I know I need help.

My arms have become impossible to not look at in the mirror, scars and cuts on every angle you could imagine, and I hate myself for it. I hate that I'm like this, I hate that I have to explain to people what happened, I just tell little kids that ""It's just crayon,"" because they aren't old enough and mature to understand what I've been through or why my arms look like that, older people are smart enough to understand whats going on.

I just wish I could be better, I wish I could be the son my parents wanted, not some mentally fucked kid who's about to enter adult-hood. My mother fears for what I might do once I leave the house, I do as well. I don't want to live, yet I fear for what comes after death, I know there is room for improvement, I know I have potential, but I'm just so burnt out and depressed from everything, it piles up, day after day. I don't have a job, and I know it's going to be one hell of a time getting one due to my scars, hopefully I have some luck getting one next month.

I see everyone at school happy, living their best life, enjoying their younger years, and I wonder to myself, ""Why can't I be like them?"" I understand that everyone has their imperfections, that's what makes us human, but why did I have to have so many? Why do I have to go through the struggle of depression and the though of suicide. Why me?

I try my best to help other people, as I know what it's like and that I want them to be nothing like me, not mentally at least. I don't want other people to contemplate ending them selves, I don't want people to be hurt or alone, yet, it happens anyways.

With me being autistic, I've always been an outcast, I don't have many friends and my social skills are God-awful, so I've never really gotten help from people my age. I talk to my mom about it, but all she says is that ""There is no reason you should be hurting yourself,"" and that ""I don't understand why you do it."" I told her, ""You don't understand because you haven't been through it, you don't see a reason as to why because you haven't been where I have."" She just scolded me afterwards for ""talking back,"" but I was trying to speak my mind, it just made me feel worse, does my own mother even care that I could take my own life?

Sorry for such a long post, I just wanted to get it all out since I've kinda had it built up for a good while, I've reached out to my friends for my help, and all they tell me is to stop being a pussy and man up, so they don't help either.

1js5nsp,i think i’m too self aware of death,"here is a diary entry i wrote today. im sharing this for advice to stop this thought process or to offer any comfort for people who relate. 

TW: discussion of death/suicide

“I’m so tired. I’ve been on fluoxetine for a few weeks now and I feel like nothings changed really. I probably need my dosage upped. I know it’s just my depression but god it sucks. 

I can’t stop thinking about death. Originally it terrified me, but now I don’t really mind the thought. I feel like there is something after it because there is 100% something bigger than us that we cannot comprehend, but even if it is eternal nothingness, that’s fine too. It scares me but when I think about it, it doesn’t seem so bad. We create our own reality and what-not. 

It does kind of make me feel hopeless in a way. Nothing matters which is good but also literally nothing matters, so what’s the point? Im excited to see what happens when I die but I don’t want to kill myself. I know my life will fly by and I’ll be in the grave before I know it. I can just think myself in circles forever. 

How can I focus on what matters when I know it really doesn’t? I just want to feel happy and be able to function. 

Like I do truly believe life is a gift but I can’t bring myself to do anything. I just need to clean my room. But I can’t move. I’m going to die one day. I should make the most out of life. But I can’t move.”

1jrzesm,My antidepressants are working,"I've been feeling so great lately, and wanted to share it somewhere. I, 14F, had recently started taking antidepressants. I'm kind of lucky, since most parents don't recognize depression as something serious in teens, but my mom has BD and wanted to help me out when I told her I was self harming again. So, at first I wasn't sure if it was working, since I was feeling pretty much normal. But one day I didn't take my meds, and I was feeling so shitty, I was thinking of wanting to die literally every second, had a strong desire to cut myself etc. So I ate and took my antidepressant, and almost immediately it went away. Not that my mood was better or anything, but I didn't think of anything bad like this. I'm honestly so glad I finally got help! I was living like this for about 6 years without it, and to think there are people who live way longer with depression and don't treat it seriously.. that's horrible. I also went to psychologists a lot in the past, but they never helped me, I think visiting them only made me feel worse. My depression isn't severe nor slight, I'd say it's mid-ish, well, that's what my mom's psychiatrist friend said. Also, it's way easier for me to do hygiene and everything, unlike the times where I couldn't even move in my bed. Overall, I'm so pleased with the experience.

Today's been a roller coaster of emotions, I've have a half glass of wine, about 100ml of gin poured into a ginger beer and a entire bottle of vanilla extract for the alc.

I want to kill myself, I've overate a shitload and vomited it all up and now my throat hurts, I've done half a dozen bajillion jumping jacks and 3 times i've tried doing pushups to about 15x each to not feel like a fatass, I've cut my arm and leg with a ripped off peace of a ginger beer can lid, and I spent 15 minutes sharpening a knife to slash up my back.

I've tried getting work done, I submitted one thing, did a tiny bit of something else, procrastinated most of the day, watched bojack horseman season 6 and a couple episodes of TEAR ALONG THE DOTTED LINE,

So is it ok to be religious, if I feel like the faith isn't born of love even if I want it to be, but instead subconsiously as a shield from myself to keep me alive even if I can't trust myself with that task.

Let's just start with i dont feel alright. Its not that I'm sick or disabled or anything. Its more of a mental problem. Things just tend to never feel right with me. Even if I hang out with friends I always feel lonely. Even if I talk to the person I love (well even she left me like everyone else) I always feel empty and even if I'm surrounded by my family that I think cares about me I always feel like nobody would miss me. This.. this feeling i just wish i never had it. I wish that I was normal that I felt happy when being friends, I felt happy when talking to people I care about, I felt happy with my family and everyone I care about. But I dont idk what to do anymore idk what I should do anymore. It just feels empty, I feel empty. Everything thats happened everything that I've done to this point was there even a meaning to it was there even a need to do all of it was there anything that I did to even help anyone. Whats the point then whats the point of all the choices I made everything that I did if it was all for nothing. What was the point of me just being alive.. when there's nothing to even do, all my problems and all my pain what even am I bearing it for? Was I just born on this earth to suffer or will I ever find something or someone worth living for? I sound like a bad fucking poet with all this but I mean every word of it. Everything here is my thoughts. I'm such an idiot things wouldve been fine maybe if I just stopped overthinking all the time. Maybe I would be happier but what can I do i think too much and care too much for people that never felt the same towards me. One of the reasons why in the end im the one that turns out to be hurt the most. I just i really just dk what to do, my minds been fucked so many times that I feel like its given up on even functioning anymore. My body feels like its given up on waking up in the mornings that it just wants to lie down forever and eventually die. My heart still beats but it feels like it stopped beating years ago. When every part of me has given up why tf am i still here why cant I just leave this place once and for all why cant I just pass on and never have to feel like this. Everyone says time heals everything but what if time itself was the reason ur hurting what if because of time u always have new problems. If there was a way to I wish time would've just stopped for eternity rn. I dont want to be hurt anymore I dont want to broken anymore I just want to have whatevers left of me to not be hurt why cant anyone see that..

I just want to die as soon as possible even rn as I'm typing this id rather die by a heart attack or the ceiling collapsing and falling on me then write all this. The most hurtful thing I think I've heard is that dont commit suicide or u don't have the balls to commit suicide. Ur wrong I would have committed suicide and I can commit suicide even rn but what to do when my stupid caring head won't stop thinking of all the things that would happen the problems my mom would face, the blame that would fall on her for not doing anything but what can even my mom do. I'm no more the same boy that she took care of and brought up, im just a broken puppet that only feels pain and suffering. Its come to a point where the one thing that I thought would save me feels like a lost cause. 

Love works in mysterious ways some people say it can heal anything but how am I supposed to believe that if no one can even love me. Depression really is one fucked feeling when you've had to wake up feeling it for more than a decade.

Currently I'm unemployed and I don't have a degree. I stay at home all day doing nothing. That's mainly how I've wasted the past five years of my life. I wish I went off to university, took it seriously, made a group of friends, and studied abroad. I wake up every day and think about how I would be studying abroad right now and the memories I would have made. There are no second chances since I come from a low income family. I ask myself why I did the things I did, even though I know that my family is working class. I don't come from a wealthy background so what made me think I had any time or money to waste? Now I am 5 years (which is a fucking long time) behind everyone and I'm watching all of my friends graduate, study in Europe (which I want but will never get to do due to finances, ruining my academic record, and running out of time), and make good money. There is literally no way to catch up to not just to my friends, but to the vision I had for my life. I also still live with my parents in the 570 sq ft one bedroom apartment that I grew up in (I sleep in the living room on a twin bed). I can't stand to live here anymore, but I'm broke. I don't even want to live in Canada anymore. Moving elsewhere likely wouldn't make me happier since I would be even more lonely than I am now. Getting a minimum wage job and moving out is not the solution because minimum wage/close to minimum wage is not sustainable for the rest of my life. The only thing I can feasibly do is get a bachelor's in nursing, but it feels like a last resort. I know I left myself with no choices. I really cannot see myself living in this city for the next 5-7 years and have been contemplating suicide. I really feel trapped and don't see a way out. I had a vision for my 20s, which would have started with a memorable time in university, but I not only missed the boat on that, I have wasted 5 years of youth that I will never get back and am left in a position where I'll be poor for a very long time. University would have been the most likely and easiest place for dating, but that option is closed to me forever. That environment is important to me because it would have been the most organic way to make friends and to meet someone my age to date.

1js18sk,Im so tired,"Im 15 years old and im a complete and utter failure in every sense of the word. Ive completely failed in my school life, I haven’t done a complete year of school since 3rd grade. I have no friends, no girlfriend, no social life, no nothing.

All I do all day is lay down, disappointing everyone while wasting my youth and watching tv and jerking off. My porn addiction has spiraled completely out of control, on most days it’s the first thing I look at when I wake up and the last thing I see before I go to bed. It’s the only thing that I can derive pleasure from now. It’s been a part of my life since I was 10. There’s no stopping it, it’s just consumed me and is as much a part of me as my arms.

The loneliness kills me. I can’t talk to anyone. My therapist just says “im sorry” or “that sounds horrible”, and G-d forbid i talk about suicide, suddenly Im at a hospital and I feel even worse. I have a friend. A single friend. Who I’ve never met, only talk to once every couple of weeks, and whom I constantly annoy. She has her own major problems and thus I can’t burden her with mine. I’ve tried talking to family, my dad says “when I was your age I was depressed too. Now Im not” or something like that and my mom just turns everything into a lecture about how everything is my dad’s fault.

And the worst part? It’s all my own doing. I can’t claim “it’s a conspiracy by the healthy people of the world trying to keep me like this” or something. It’s all me. I could go talk to a girl at the mall, or go back to school, but I won’t. Living like this is both the easiest and hardest thing I’ve ever done. I have no responsibility, no hunger or economic problems, my life is fine. But the pain, loneliness, anxiety, and general hell ive inflicted on myself makes me wish to just crawl into my pit and die.

I can’t kill my self. Not due to lack of want, but due to lack of follow through. I know that no matter how hard things get, I can never kill myself. I will continue to wallow in this shit for the rest of my life.

My dad recently went to the doctor due to severe insomnia and was diagnosed with depression and anxiety. I'm a college student living away from home, and when I returned home this month, I noticed a heavy atmosphere in the house. My father tends to overthink and worry about all kinds of things, especially about finances, even though our family is quite well-off. He keeps lamenting, which makes my mother exhausted and irritable, and since my younger sibling is still small, only my mom can take care of them right now. The doctor prescribed antidepressants for my father, but she's not a mental health specialist, so I’m not sure how effective the treatment will be.

However, because we're in a third world country, my parents are also quite prejudiced against therapy or seeing a psychologist.

1js0jxd,I feel so lost [TW: Violence],"I feel so lost in life. I am almost 25 years old and without a job. Living with my mother. I do not think I have had a very nice childhood. I have been seeing abuse(both verbal and physical) in my household since I was a child. I remember when I was 7, I would have these anxiety episodes in school because I would be so worried that my parents would be fighting back home. It used to be mostly my father physically assaulting my mother and sometimes even my elder sisters. Often times my mother would leave the house but then my father would get all emotional and gaslight her into coming back. My mother and sister cut contacts with him finally for good when my father almost attacked my sister with a knife. I was at college some 2000kms away during this time. 

Being aware of what was going on back at home, I became extremely depressed and stressed and hence my grades took a steep nosedive. The repercussion of which I still have to face today. Once I graduate with my master's, I decided to pursue my dream of getting a PhD in theoretical physics. But because of my research area being probably the most demanding field in physics, the grade requirement for almost half of the places was beyond what I had obtained. I have excellent research experience and even though my transcript might not reflect my knowledge, I have done a good self study of those topics and I am as knowledgable as any person working in this field. Despite that, all I have faced is rejection in this whole application process which has lasted for almost 1.5 years now. 

Moving on to my personal life, I have never felt a sense of belonging to be honest. Having an extremely strict father, I never got the opportunity to hang out with my friends much and hence I could not develop a bond. I have always felt like an outsider in every friend circle I have hung out with. I have had these so called ""friends"" bitch about me behind my back. My girlfriend and I decided to part ways because of long distance and within 2 weeks of breaking up, my girlfriend started dating someone else. Which is absolutely fine, but it hurts me a lot for some reason. 

I have tread into the territory of online dating and I think I am quite fun to be around. Plenty of women have expressed their interests in me but somehow I always feel this bubble around me which prevents me to be get closer to those women and hence I never go beyond the usual situationships. I feel so lost in life because I do not see any way out of my condition. Every day feels like a burden on me and my body. I hate getting out of bed and I hate doing anything. Sometimes I think how nice it would be if I just never existed. I know there is a paradox there but I do not have the energy to go on anymore.

I was genuinely speechless because I genuinely completely forget that some people actively like enjoy living? It's so weird to me - I was looking at this networking website and the it asked what was your childhood dream with options like change the world or be rich but I don't remember ever wanting or desiring anything long term.

 Same with the future. I'm finding it hard to pick a career etc because there's nothing that I want in life. I have no hobbies and believe me I've tried because I don't enjoy anything either. I take on a lot of work just to fill the gap. I don't actively want to die either but I wouldn't mind it because a. I'm v bored and b. talks like mentioned remind me of how much resources are wasted on me that could go to someone actively interested in life.

 I'm not sad or happy. And I never really remember being extremely happy. Apparently I did at some point but I have no memory of it. Sometimes it feels like I'm an outside alien observing the earth. It's absolutely fascinating to me when people are passionate about things because I just don't know what it feels like to care about something. 

I'd be suicidal if I also wasn't passionate about dying enough. Sometimes I wish I was back to sad depression, when I actively was crying and stuff, rather than this numbness.

It explains in detail why *any* validation of suicidal intent, even an ""innocent"" message like ""if you're 100% committed, I'll just wish you peace"" is likely to increase people's pain, and why it's important to report even subtle pro-suicide comments. The full text of the wiki's current version is below, and it is maintained at [/r/SuicideWatch/wiki/incitement](http://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/wiki/incitement). 

We deeply appreciate everyone who gives responsive, empathetic, non-judgemental support to our OPs, and we particularly thank everyone who's already been reporting incitement in all forms.

###Summary###

**It's important to respect and understand people's experiences and emotions. It's never necessary, helpful, or kind to support suicidal intent. There are some common misconceptions (discussed below) about suicidal people and how to help them that can cause well-meaning people to inadvertently incite suicide. There are also people online who incite suicide on purpose, often while pretending to be sympathetic and helpful.** 

###Validate Feelings and Experiences, Not Self-Destructive Intentions###

We're here to offer support, not judgement.  That means accepting, with the best understanding we can offer, whatever emotions people express.  Suicidal people are suffering, and we're here to try to ease that by providing support and caring.  The most reliable way we know to de-escalate someone at risk is to give them the experience of feeling understood. That means not judging whether they should be feeling the way they are, or telling them what to do or not do.  

But there's an important line to draw here.  There's a crucial difference between empathizing with feelings and responding non-judgmentally to suicidal thoughts, and in any way endorsing, encouraging, or validating suicidal intentions or hopeless beliefs. **It's both possible and important to convey understanding and compassion for someone's suicidal thoughts without putting your finger on the scale of their decision.**

Anything that condones suicide, even passively, *encourages* suicide. It isn't supportive and does not help. It also violates reddit's sitewide rules as well as our guidelines. Explicitly inciting suicide online is a criminal offense in most jurisdictions. 

Do not treat any OP's post as meaning that will definitely die by suicide and can't change their minds or be helped. Anyone who's able to read the comments here still has a chance to choose whether or not to try to keep living, even if they've also been experiencing intense thoughts of suicide, made a suicide plan, or started carrying it out.  

In [the most useful empirical model we have](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpersonal_theory_of_suicide), the desire to die by suicide primarily comes from two interpersonal factors; alienation and a sense of being a burden or having nothing to offer. These factors usually lead to a profound feeling of being unwelcome in the world. 

**So, any acceptance or reinforcement of suicidal intent, even something ""innocent"" like ""I hope you find peace"", is actually a form of covert shunning that validates a person's sense that they're unwelcome in the world. It will usually add to their pain even if kindly meant and gently worded.**  

###How to Avoid Validating Suicidal Intent###

Keep the following in mind when offering support to anyone at risk for suicide.  

* **People who say they don't want help usually can feel better if they get support that doesn't invalidate their emotions.** Unfortunately, [many popular ""good"" responses are actually counterproductive](https://www.speakingofsuicide.com/2015/03/03/what-not-to-say/). In particular, many friends and family tend to rely exclusively on trying to convince the suicidal person that ""it's not so bad"", and this is usually experienced as ""I don't understand what you're going through and I'm not going to try"".  People who've had ""help"" that made them feel worse don't want any more of the same.  It doesn't mean that someone who actually knows how to be supportive can't give them any comfort.   

*  **Most people who are suicidal want to end their** ***pain,*** **not their lives.**  It's almost never true that death is the only way to end these people's suffering. Of course there are exceptional situations, and we certainly acknowledge that, for some people, the right help can be difficult to find. But preventing someone's suicide doesn't mean prolonging their suffering if we do it by giving them real comfort and understanding. 

* ***An unfixable problem doesn't mean that a good life will never be possible***.  We don't have to fix or change anything to help someone feel better. It's important to keep in mind that the correlation between our outer circumstances and our inner experience is weaker and less direct than commonly assumed.  For every kind of difficult life situation, you will find some people who lapse into suicidal despair, and others who cope amazingly well, and a whole spectrum in between. A key difference is how much inner resilience the person has at the time. This can depend on many personal and situational factors. But when there's not enough, interpersonal support can both compensate for its absence and help rebuild it.  We go into more depth on the ""it gets better"" issue in [this PSA Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/25igd7/whats_wrong_with_it_gets_better_what_if_it_doesnt/) which is always linked from our sidebar (community info on mobile) guidelines. 

* **There are** ***always*** **more choices than brutally forcing someone to stay alive or passively letting them end their lives**.

To avoid accidentally breaking the anti-incitement rule, don't say or try to imply that acting on suicidal thoughts is a good idea, or that someone can't turn back or is already dead.  Do whatever you can to help them feel cared for and welcome, at least in this little corner of the world.  [Our talking tips](http://redd.it/igh87) offer more detailed guidance.

###Look Out for Deliberate Incitement.  It May Come in Disguise.###

Often comments that subtly encourage suicidal intent actually come from suicide fetishists and voyeurs ([unfortunately this is a real and disturbing phenomenon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Francis_Melchert-Dinkel)). People like this *are* out there and the anonymous nature of reddit makes us particularly attractive to them.  

They will typically try to scratch their psychological ""itch"" by saying things that push people closer to the edge.  They often do this by exploiting the myths that we debunked in the bullet points above.  Specifically you might see people doing the following:

* Encouraging the false belief that the only way suicidal people can end their pain is by dying.  **There are** ***always*** **more and better choices than ""brutally forcing someone to stay alive"" or helping (actively or passively) them to end their lives**.

* Creating an artificial and toxic sense of ""solidarity"" by linking their encouragement of suicide to empathy.  They will represent themselves as the only one who really understand the suicidal person, while either directly or indirectly encouraging their self-loathing emotions and self-destructive impulses.  **Since most people in suicidal crisis are in desperate need to empathy and understanding, this is a particularly dangerous form of manipulation.**  

Many suicide inciters are adept at putting a benevolent spin on their activities while actually luring people away from sources of real help.  A couple of key points to keep in mind: 

* **Skilled suicide intervention -- peer or professional -- is based on empathic responsiveness to the person's feelings that reduces their suffering in the moment.**  Contrary to pop-culture myths, it does **not** involve persuasion (""Don't do it!""), cheerleading (""You've got this!"") or meaningless false promises (""Trust me, it gets better!""), or invalidation (""Let me show you how things aren't as bad as you think!"").  Anyone who leads others to expect these kinds of toxic responses, or any other response that prolongs their pain, from expert help may be covertly pro-suicide. (Of course, people sometimes do have bad experience when seeking mental-health treatment, and it's fine to vent about those, but processing our own disappointment and frustration is entirely different from trying to destroy someone else's hope of getting help.)

* **Choices made by competent responders are always informed by the understanding that breaching someone's trust is traumatic and must be avoided if possible.**  Any kind of involuntary intervention is an **extremely unlikely** outcome when someone consults a clinician or calls a hotline. (Confidentiality is addressed in more detail in [our Hotlines FAQ post](http://redd.it/1c7ntr)). The goal is always to provide all help with the client's full knowledge and informed consent. We know that no individual or system is perfect.  Mistakes that lead to bad experiences do sometimes happen to vulnerable people, and we have enormous sympathy for them. But anyone who suggests that this is the norm might be trying to scare people away from the help they need.  

Please [let us know discreetly](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FSuicideWatch) if you see anyone exhibiting these or similar behaviours.

pl9suy,Please remember that NO ACTIVISM of any kind is ever allowed here. No matter what day it is.,"Activism, i.e. advocating or fundraising for social change or raising awareness of social issues (and suicide is, inescapably, a social issue) is absolutely against the rules here at all times. 

Please understand that we're all for smart, strategic mental-health and suicide-prevention activism. It's essential to fight against stigma, misinformation, and discrimination, and to fight for research, treatment, accommodation, acceptance, and understanding. Most of us, one way or another, are mental-health activists IRL. 

But activism just doesn't work in a dedicated support space that serves a vulnerable population. We used to allow it but the evidence that it was undermining our primary purpose became overwhelming.  We do regret the need for this rule, but the need is inescapable. 

Our population is all too well aware of the issues and causes that need support and largely not in a position to take action, so besides the fact that activism is often salt in our community's wounds, it's a waste of the activists' time.

**tl;dr** Any fundraising, awareness raising, petitions, calls for participation, or any post that's about any cause or issue (rather than a request for personal support) is not allowed here.  Please report everything of the nature that you see.",SQLwitch,716,43,1631232110.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/pl9suy/please_remember_that_no_activism_of_any_kind_is/,Positive,High Risk

1js5kb8,"Being an ugly woman is exhausting, Id rather be dead","So many women at my work are beautiful. I’m generally neutral about my appearance. Even though I know I’m ugly, I’ve mostly come to accept it. But being around so many beautiful women is like being stabbed in the gut with a hot knife LOL.

A lot of guys have been quite cruel to me about my appearance, even some guys I considered my friends. I remember in dance class in high school a guy tried to swap partners with his friend so that he could be partnered with my friend instead. Because I was too ugly. And they were fighting over it bro 😭. I remember being catcalled in college, but when I turned to look at the guys, they all laughed at how I looked. 

I just wish I could be beautiful for one day, solely because of the way other people treat me. I wish I could wear the clothes I want to wear without being stared at in disgust. I’m so far behind in life.

Honestly suicide seems like an easy fix for this at this point. Being ugly is extremely exhausting 24/7 and the only time I can escape it is when I’m sleeping.

1jryr8c,My husband doesn’t care,"I’ve struggled with suicidal ideations for nearly 25 years now. I attempted at 15 but obviously wasn’t successful. When I was 16 I got pregnant and at 6 weeks pregnant my boyfriend committed suicide. I wanted nothing more than to join him but I stayed for my child. I’ve stayed for my child for over 21 years now and now that they are grown I want to leave more than ever. I try my best to hang on for them but they have their own life and only come around when they need something. I’ve tried so many different medications, they work for a while then quit working. I just came off yet another medication my Dr had me try and I swear it made me worse. I work in public safety and can’t openly talk about my struggles without chancing losing my job. I work night shift and when I’m at work I’m ok. When I’m home, alone at night, the feelings nearly drown me. I sold my pistol and I don’t have medications here to OD on and I’m terrified of the pain of cutting myself. I have an immense fear that the medics (that I dispatch) will be the ones who have to come and try to save me and see me at my worst and most vulnerable. 

I mentioned to my husband I was feeling like I didn’t want to be alive anymore tonight (it’s been really bad the past 2 weeks and I’ve mentioned it a few times) and he asked if I wanted to borrow a gun. I told him no. He asked how I wanted to do it and I said pills and he asked if I had any to do it and I just shook my head. He then started talking about how long it’s been since we’ve had sex and that he could put me in a better mood and then he got mad and went down the hallway muttering things I couldn’t hear and slammed the bedroom door. I took an extra dose of my anxiety meds and made myself pass out for a little while to quiet the thoughts. I wish he cared, it might be easier to fight this if I had someone beside me to help me fight it.

1js4hj2,I hate life right now,"I’m not the best person, I abuse drugs, I flip out over small things so frequently it’s like I’m a completely new person when I do flip and I don’t know what’s wrong with me.

I’ve had a history of anger issues and no diagnosis for anything besides severe depression and severe anxiety which was obvious. They put me on pills and I abused those.

What really brought me here was I’ve been declining massively in my mental health. My mom provides me alcohol, weed(it’s legal where I am) and vapes to get me off her nerves. Once I broke down crying for no reason so she locked me in the bathroom and handed me a vape and told me to work it out myself.  I don’t consider her a bad mom all the time, sometimes i hate her and I can’t stand her and other times i love her and miss her. It’s the same with everyone I flip and flop between resentment and love.

I got into an argument with my mom once before and she told me I’m not depressed and I have no reason to be. I’m spoiled, lazy and a brat for thinking I have any real struggles going on. She said this while I was in the middle of working with the police to report a guy who had sexually abused me since I was young. But since we’re in the same grade nothing came of it. I have a lot of history with sexual trauma, physical and mental trauma. And it’s all disregarded because when I try to speak to my mom she tells me nothing I have going on is as bad as hers or my sisters..

All of that doesn’t help with my body image either, I grew up being the ugly, emotional tall one. I had too many emotions or too little and I was a genuine asshole. I got mad over little things and boys would use that to pick with me. recently guys are all over me trying to get with me to have sex (including my abusers). Some only wanted to fuck because they wanted to prove they could before my ex boyfriend/abuser could. Despite how many people tell me they care and I’m pretty and I’m not just a sex appeal I can’t see myself any other way. 

All of that stress built up and made me relapse, the constant back and forth with my family, boyfriend and friends made me go insane, I felt guilty for reporting the guy who assaulted me. He makes me feel guilty about it daily as well. I stayed up and relapsed, cutting my vein with a razor blade, drinking until I nearly threw up and smoking weed so my room filled with smoke. It made me feel so much better until I woke up the next morning and wanted to die mainly because of a hangover but also because how disappointed my boyfriend would be.

When he wakes up we’re supposed to talk about it. How do I tell him I want to die, but don’t want to go to an asylum? I have poor memory and won’t be able to remember his number if I go. And I’m genuinely attached to him when I don’t have mood swings without him I feel empty and suicidal. I’m sorry for anyone who decided to read lmao

I’ve tried my best to battle this mental illness (mix of depression, anxiety & bipolar disorder) for about 17 years now but I can’t go on anymore. I’m numb & empty - feeling like a shell of my old self. I’ve tried several different medications & different therapies (CBT, ECT & TMS) including inpatient stays at hospital but still I’m miserable. I can’t hold down a job for long over the last 6 years, my romantic relationships always fail & I’ve drifted away from family and friends. I always seem to stuff things up, making terrible decisions & I’ve lost the desire, purpose & direction that I need to continue. I’m tired, fed up & don’t have the fight in me anymore. I’m struggling to look after myself, am nearly broke & soon to be bankrupt. 
I don’t see things improving either & I genuinely believe that my race in this life has run it’s course. Apologies for all the pain this will cause, but I need to stop this unbearable pain & horrible suffering for me. Hopefully you’ll remember the happy, social and funny person that I once was & the good times we shared. Finally, I hope you can forgive me for this decision I’ve made but know I fought bloody hard to survive all these years & for as long as I could but I’m exhausted & need to rest. I hope you can take comfort that I’m finally at peace now.

1iwvbzn,r/Anxiety is looking for new moderators,"Hello friends!

We're looking to grow the moderation team here at [r/Anxiety](https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/). Moderators are a key part of what makes any Reddit community special. If you are interested in helping to make this community special, we'd like to talk to you.

# What does a moderator do?

Moderators here at [r/Anxiety](https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/) work to build our community and make this a safe place to discuss the many facets of anxiety and the ways that anxiety and mental wellness influence daily life. Moderators help to write the rules, respond to content concerns, set policies, update community themes and appearance, manage automation, and general upkeep.

# What are the minimum requirements to apply?

If you care about mental health and would like to be a part of our amazing team of moderators, then we'd like to hear from you. Prior experience is a plus, but not the most important thing we're looking for. We want moderators who care about the topic of anxiety and the r/Anxiety community, fit well with our team, and want to help.

If this describes you, there are some steps below that we'd like you to take to apply. These steps include some open-ended questions that we'd like your thoughtful answers on. Everything else that you might need to know, we can help you learn along the way. If you're interested in moderating and want to get a head start on all there is to know, we recommend you [check out the Reddit training offered here.](https://redditforcommunity.com/)

# What are the expectations for users who join the r/Anxiety moderation team?

We need people who will engage and communicate about what they see and what questions they have. Our moderation team is supportive and understanding. We know you have a life outside of Reddit, and we expect you to put that life first. Sometimes that means you might have less time to moderate and that's okay. We expect communication and coordination so that we can support each other and bring in more help when we need to.

# Anything I should know before I apply?

Yes, [r/Anxiety](https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/) is a support community for anxiety and other related illnesses and we often encounter posts and comments that describe traumatic experiences or crisis. Some of this content can be disturbing.

Our team policy is that when a post or comment is too much for one of us to handle, we let the rest of the team know and someone else will step in to handle it, *but there is no way to eliminate the exposure completely*.

If you apply, please expect that we will ask you about your comfort level in moderating content of this nature and what strategies you might use to make sure your own mental health needs are met.

No one is expected to address issues that are uncomfortable for them, but you should expect to encounter such things if you join the team.

Second, we require that moderators join our Discord server, where we communicate and coordinate our moderation efforts. Part of the application process includes joining us on that server for a chat. You will need a Discord account (can be an existing account if you have one).

# How do I apply?

If you are interested in joining our team, here is the process we follow:

1. Send us a [modmail](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=r/anxiety) indicating that you are interested and include answers to the following questions:
   * What does mental health mean to you?
   * Why are you interested in being a moderator on r/Anxiety ?
   * In your opinion, what are some differences between a good moderator and a bad moderator?
2. We will review your [modmail](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=r/anxiety) and your application. If we find your answers satisfactory, we will send a form for you to fill out.
3. We will invite candidates we think might be a good fit to join us on our Discord server so we can interact and get to know each other before making a decision on extending an invitation to be a moderator.
4. New moderators on the r/Anxiety moderator team start out with a trial run that will last about three weeks. During that time, the trial moderator will have limited moderation responsibilities, both for evaluation and to help provide a structured way to get up to speed.

Thanks for reading, and we hope you apply!",Pi25,16,8,1740377437.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1iwvbzn/ranxiety_is_looking_for_new_moderators/,Positive,Low Concern

We want this to serve as casual community chat for anyone who wants to get or stay involved without having to make a full post.

1js3975,"I am done. Anxiety disorders have reduced my quality of life to miserable. Not homeless, got all 4 limbs BUT so what if I can't enjoy life regardless. CPTSD causing crushing bouts of prolonged severe anxiety turned out to be the last straw. BACK TO CLONAZEPAM (Klonopin).","Everyone either mention the two above, or having a family, or being able to get education...

...and I surely would appreciate, and DID appreciate life before...
...before repeated emotional trauma.
Additionally the exposure (a good non-pharm. coping/therapy method don't get me wrong!) was just a bit too far too soon and...messed me up even more.
I went through NINE semesters of med school 1.5 a year away from getting an M.D. title.
I broke down even more.

Alcohol makes my body feel poisoned, so I drowned my sorrows in benzos. Abused them.
Even though I MAY STILL GO BACK and FINISH...
I Broke down again, and again.

Started abusing both clonazepam and alprazolam but addiction to the latter for me was worse, because alprazolam (Xanax) lasts 4-5h and clonazepam (Klonopin Rivotril etc.) about 4 times as long.

My anxiety is all day-long and chronic but the trauma-related attacks of sheer panic are just soul crushing. Alprazolam won't do the trick because they can last for entire days.

I got diagnosed with ADHD in the meantime and by sheer miracle.
When I started failing med school due to anxiety making me a literal living mess, I got myself some Ritalin out of desperation for studying...kind of a forced ADHD diagnosis. A sin of mine that um paid off actually.

And thinking how it being a stimulant is basically the polar opposite of benzos these being CNS depressants or colloquially ""downers""...I was initially quite careful starting on 10mg.
Nothing.
Let's try 20mg said my doc a week after 10mg use.
""Ok"".

Dude. Helped my anxiety,
my depression,
my lack of energy and lethargic mindset,
 my boredom,
 my focus,
 my creativity...

Later down the line /a digresssion here/ it alleviated anxiety caused by XANAX WITHDRAWAL.
Then I paid attention and my strong black double Coffee slightly HELPS my anxiety too, unless I went further, but that's due to heart and BP obviously.

Took the tests, the funny simulated one, the questionare, evaluated by a psychologist/analyst...ADHD plain as day.

Later, my benzo habit got tapered, I got switched to Lyrica - pregabalin.
It worked wonders for generalized anxiety especially. 2 or 3 years and plop tolerance ruins all of it.
And 1200mg / 24h is no longer a medical dosing, and I get that.

Benzos got even more demonized than before but I had regretted so badly going overboard with them.

When Lyrica lost effectiveness...my main-line anxiolytic agent became...Ritalin. Or just methylphenidate as this was not the original formula.

I used twice as much methylphenidate as per doctors instructions.
When asked why - for anxiety, staggering the doses...since it fits with the dopamine fingers into my brain being a glove I could take 30mg instant release and go asleep.

But my new doc was kind enough to understand. Iost my will to seek new things educate myself make friends etc.
I'm 31. Sometimes I'm met with ""Ahh so young you shouldn't be taking such strong meds!""
When it comes to my own alley - that of mental anguish - that nearly drove me S. At worst point,
That caused me to become a chain smoker as first cig came a decade before getting Ritalin and never been able to quit - being at med school I got comments by my ""peers"", obviously,
and I may already be caring a mutation in my lower Airways up to 3 decades too soon...
...after my family members became distant as I'm a ""junkie"" if I plead for one medication that helps me function just-well-enough, and another that helps Save my sanity...

Doc gave me 2mg klonopin daily, dosed twice 1mg. Despite previous mistakes.
I'll never repeat them due to how much anguish this med can relieve. Never increase dose without asking psych doc. It's there and I already feel safer...
...which arrogant people will contribute to addiction despite having had a 3 year break, impossible physical aspect with mental diminished as if I F up and start abusing the med and chase that blasted dragon and eventually WILL have the med stopped forever - I wouldn't forgive myself

Currently 1mg - (5-6h) - 1mg considering clonazepam...

1. Pregabalin dropped from 1500mg daily to 900mg by using clonazepam for a week. Mind you, I'm V-E-R-Y dependent on this med. Goal is 600mg daily but at that point I'm fairly sure it won't work at all - and may quit altogether.

2. Methylphenidate (Ritalin) dropped from 108 mg [YEAH] (usually 40mg - 40mg - 28mg type deal immediate release 3h between doses).
Without propranolol additionally, (great nonaddictive med for somatic anxiety symptoms) hell my heart and BP would be too far...I wouldn't take it.
One week passed. From the average 108mg I went to 54mg daily taken in prolonged release formula.

So.
2mg of clonazepam dosed twice in 1mg doses for a week.

Results are,
1. Lyrica 1.5k mg /24h down by 600mg to 900mg
2. Ritalin used as per doctor's instruction. The abhorrent 108mg in spaced doses cut down by HALF into single 54mg XR formula. The Ritalin can now be used for ADHD proper and not handle ADHD AND anxiety disorders at once.

Hurr durr 2mg of clonazepam. Hurr durr BZD addict relapsing.


Humans and human life are too complicated to be put into 0 - 1ish labels of thinking.

My intention is by no means a glorification of clonazepam of benzos in general.

It's just that some people have less left to lose than meets the eye, and also, 5 years can give a lot to think through, mature, and maybe given how their lives are s*itty regardless and dose 2x max 24h medical max of two meds one no longer working another used off label due to necessity...

Well for me the effects are here. Once I go down to 600mg Lyrica daily so both meds are in medically allowed dose range..don't know.

The 2mg daily of clonazepam is 3 weeks tops but if things go messy and I start abusing another med, then clonazepam is back to action right away.

I originally went because of scary heart palpitations but apparently those aren't to worry about.

My heart palpitations decreased, and my resting HR also became better (went down to like 70 bpm), however, I still have some scary spikes even when I'm not doing exercise.

Like, simple walking, maybe a bit uphill but slow walking and it's like 150-160 bpm.
Or getting dressed and it's like 130 bpm.
I don't feel it, I have no shortness of breath, but I can see it when I check my smartwatch.

Does anyone have any experience with this?
I'm always anxious (I have GAD) but today I'm even more anxious than usual - wondering if that's why it spiked to 165...

1js45dp,SSRIs reality support and how to beat anxiety.,"I remember when I started taking the medication — I was only 17, dealing with anxiety and OCD. Like everyone else, I just wanted to feel ‘normal’ again, to feel like I did before, but that never really happened… until I started taking escitalopram.

The first two weeks were intense, but then I started feeling better — a bit of peace in my head. In the end, I was just a scared kid who wanted to feel okay. After a few months, things improved, and I started feeling normal. I felt calm and good, but also a bit numb and unmotivated, which is a side effect of the medication. You don’t feel bad, but you don’t feel great either — it dulls your emotions. But I didn’t care, I kept going.

Eventually, I reached a point where I thought I didn’t need it anymore, so I started tapering off. I stopped abruptly because I felt fine and wanted to feel that way without the pill. At first, I still felt okay — but no one had warned me about the withdrawal syndrome. Not even the doctor. That’s when I realized it had just been a patch for the anxiety, not a cure, and I started to understand things more clearly. Withdrawal syndrome usually causes a lot of anxiety and other symptoms. And for you that are here trying to try medication or that is passing the withdrawal symptoms. The problem is the doubt — not knowing whether it’s that or something else — may have affected. I recommend, as someone who has taken this pill, that you stop taking it and be strong. If millions have done it… you can too. Remember that pharmaceutical companies just want more money and to keep people medicated. It’s important that you understand this is just anxiety — which you already had even before taking the antidepressant. (Sorry for my English I speak Spanish)

There are people who are genuinely helped by it, no doubt, but they are much less than half, and that’s often because of the placebo effect. Doctors will tell you, “Yes, it’s definitely good to take medication, it’s a chemical imbalance in the brain,” but that’s not true! It’s really your overactive nervous system keeping you in fight-or-flight mode — as if there’s a lion in front of you that doesn’t exist, and your mind is trying to protect you from it. I recommend exercising, even if it’s hard. Stop searching on Reddit or Google. I’m here too because I’m also tapering off the medication, and I like to see how others are going through this hard time. But I’ve realized something: everyone seems to go through it in a similar way, and yet each of us has the ability to educate ourselves and face our own mind. It’s crucial to understand that this is temporary and requires a lot of patience, and to not stop doing what you truly want to do — as long as it’s something positive.

Ask any psychiatrist or psychologist if they’ve ever cured a patient, and most likely they won’t know how to answer — because anxiety, OCD, and depression aren’t cured with pills. Medication treats the symptoms, not the cause. And if there’s no apparent cause, it’s probably your thoughts — the ones you give too much value and importance to.

I’ll never forget the time I thought, “What if I hurt someone I love?” (an OCD thought). That mental trap — validating whether I was really capable of doing that — terrified me, and I started avoiding the thoughts. But that’s the real problem: avoiding them because of that mental trap. And believe it or not, everyone has those thoughts — they just don’t give them importance.

In the end, it’s all up to you — not a pill or a therapist. It sounds rough, but it’s possible. Instead of reading things on Reddit, look for stories of how people recovered from anxiety and how they faced it. Those Reddit posts are often written by people lying in bed, full of anxiety, doing nothing to get out of it — just waiting for the medicine to kick in or for something to magically change, but that doesn’t work. What works is being active, doing things you know are good for you — over and over again. It’s like taking your brain to the gym. You have to train it, and it’s rare to see immediate results at first. It takes time. The best thing is to accept where you are, stop fighting your mind (because that only makes it worse), and understand it. Understand that it’s just on high alert — and just like you entered this, you can get out of it.

I love you because I understand you, and we’re all going to get through this. ALL of us. God bless you.”",Beautiful_Opening_11,2,2,1743861771.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1js45dp/ssris_reality_support_and_how_to_beat_anxiety/,Positive,Moderate Concern
1jrxi71,"I ended a relationship with a man, now I can’t tell if I saved myself or ruined something good","I (28F) met a man (39M) on Tinder in January. He was an extroverted, athletic, more dominant; I’m introverted, creative, sensitive. We had chemistry, went on a few romantic dates, and quickly became a couple after I told him I didn’t want a casual thing. He said he wanted a relationship too.

At first, it felt magical—weekends together, trips, gifts, messages every day. He introduced me to friends and family. But then I started feeling bad in this relationship:

* He made hurtful “jokes” (“it’s your fault your parents divorced”, “you’ve never been engaged because no one was desperate enough”).
* He criticized my appearance, lifestyle, and personality in subtle ways (my apartment, clothes, being introverted).
* He said he wanted control over me, that I'd mentally break if we saw each other less.
* When I was physically unwell, he insisted on sex.
* He dismissed my stress and mental health (“you chose that job”, “what do you have to stress about”).
* Over time, affection faded. It became mostly sex. But we still met regularly, outings, trips, gifts.

Eventually, I started having anxiety, panic, physical symptoms. I couldn't express myself honestly without fearing he'd mock me or withdraw. While on a trip with a friend, I felt numb, scared, and disconnected from him. When I got back, I impulsively texted: “I don’t see the point of continuing this. I’ll send you your things.”

He was shocked, said I was disloyal, that he’d never trust me again. We met once more, and he admitted he’s not emotional, he won'’t change, and prefers when women initiate closeness. That all he said was just jokes. I called him later in panic—he was calm but said he doesn’t want to see me anymore.

After that call, my anxiety eased.

But now I’m broken with guilt. I feel like I threw away the only man who cared for me. Maybe I’ll never find someone again. I know how I behaved, and that I deserve criticism.

TL;DR: Met a charming but a little cold man. He pressured for sex, made cutting ""jokes"", lacked empathy, and couldn’t meet me emotionally. I ended it impulsively when my anxiety peaked. Now he won’t speak to me, and I’m grieving what feels like the loss of “the only one who cared.” Feeling like I ruined something good, even though I was in pain.",AdriankaOfficial,6,23,1743835847.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1jrxi71/i_ended_a_relationship_with_a_man_now_i_cant_tell/,Negative,Low Concern

I'm an iOS developer, and I made something out of a personal struggle — maybe ( and i hope ) it’ll help someone else too.

I have a tiny bit of OCD/anxiety.  
Before I leave the house, I have to check the stove, the plugs, the door lock — not just once, but multiple times. Even though i see and be sure that i checked them, i feel unsure once i'm about to leave the house.  
At office, I worry if I left the kettle or oven on.  
And when I travel, it’s a whole house wide ritual before locking the door.

Sometimes, I take photos just to reassure myself — but they end up cluttering my photo gallery and get lost among other stuff.

So I built **Phodone**, a simple to-do list app where tasks are photo-based.  
You can create a task like “Did I turn off the stove?” and confirm it with a photo every time.  
It's a tiny idea, but it's been a big help for my peace of mind.

1js64ox,has anyone else have this experience? (not asking for medical advice just seeking to see if it’s more common than I thought),"keep in mind i’ve had anxiety since 2016 and most of what triggers it is either nothing and I start panicking then can’t stop because I hate the feeling of my heart pumping or ptsd in cars because i’ve been in some really nasty car accidents as a passenger. 

so a couple of months ago (november 2024) I got my nails done as I usually do I used to get them done every 2 - 3 weeks since 2021 so this was a normal day for me. I felt my blood sugar was low and asked for a coke immediately (I had a moment one time in 2022 when my blood sugar dropped and my vision went out) and when they started taking my old nails off, I almost passed out. now at the time I thought it was something with my blood sugar so I just assumed next time I would need to get more food in my system before I go. 

but days pass and everytime i’m in a room with fluorescent lighting I almost pass out. I went to the gym because I used to go very consistently but then I felt my head start feeling weird and my vision start to go so I drive to an urgent care. they took my blood sugar, my heartbeat, this that I don’t remember it well because I was freaking out. then they told me it’s most likely caused from intense anxiety. 

so I start to calm myself down when this happens to this day and I know it’s just my anxiety because when I just have cold air blowing on me and water (more of a mental safety crutch) I feel fine. but I just started a new job where I am in other businesses for a while and yesterday I felt it happening during a close because they didn’t have air blowing and I left my water in my car. this feels so ridiculous that I can’t do my job without almost passing out from a panic attack. has anyone else experienced this?

**tldr** - I got my nails done months ago almost passed out, keep almost passing out at places with fluorescent lighting. went to urgent care they said my blood is fine and it’s probably just my anxiety. am able to calm down if I have cold air and water. can’t do my job without almost passing out if they don’t have those things.

I feel like everyone secretly hates me. I’ve been losing friends recently, and it’s made me wonder if something is inherently wrong with me. I have social anxiety, so I tend to behave awkwardly in some situations,sometimes I might come off as rude, but I never mean to hurt anyone. my friends know that, but still, I feel misunderstood and distant.
The way things are going, I’m scared I might slip into depression. And on top of all this, I’m a medical student. The pressure and the academics have really taken a toll on me. I keep wondering  am I even good enough?

I just had a breakdown. I feel like no one really understands what I’m going through. I’m not emotionally close to my family either, which makes things harder .sometimes I wish someone could just tell me what to eat, what to wear, what to do!!(everything that Fleabag said). 
I’m tired. Mentally drained. I shut down often, going into a kind of functional freeze. I want to get better, I really do, but I don’t know how. I don’t know where to start. I just… need help.

What can i do to overcome this, i do want to get better!!",Sure_Conclusion8602,2,0,1743853271.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1js1jnp/i_hate_myself/,Negative,Moderate Concern

I don’t have any more tests coming up soon but I want to try it to see what it feels like so I know what I’m getting into when it’s time to actually take a test.

1js5unu,Anxiety Meds — Need Advice,"I’m 26F, fairly healthy aside from a few stomach issues and crippling anxiety. My health anxiety is getting pretty awful, I don’t enjoy waking up because I know at some point through the day I’m going to think I’m dying. 

I’m in full time school, single mom & applying to law school. I come from multi generational trauma & most of my family has had a substance abuse issue (hence my reluctancy to take meds). I’ve been in therapy for about 5 years now and it has helped tremendously but the anxiety just doesn’t go away. The stress is real. I need help & advice. 

How have anxiety meds changed your life? I’ve tried a few, never stayed on them long enough because I felt like I had so many symptoms and was terrified. I hate taking any medication and avoid it as long as I can, even Tylenol. 

I’m constantly short of breath, anxious, nauseous, thoughts spinning etc. I see my doctor almost weekly because she wants to keep reassuring me I am in fact, not dying. 

Any advice is much appreciated. I want to know what it’s like to feel normal again. I want to do better, I want to feel better and feel like myself again — whoever that may be.

1js5lw7,Symptoms for 3 weeks,"Hi I had a health scare almost 3 weeks ago that completely threw me into a downward spiral. Luckily everything checked out fine but I still feel like I have anxiety symptoms. I developed a heavy chest, tight throat and back shoulder pain during my health scare. The back/ shoulder pain has subsided but I still have had a heavy chest daily and throat tightness with clicking feeling when I swallow. Sometimes it’s worse than other times and I don’t notice when I sleep. Could this be anxiety from my episode?

1js559x,This can’t be right,"So I’ve had symptoms for months now that are constant and never relieved, dizziness, back pain, jaw pain, neck pain, leg pain, pain in my sides, strange sensation in my stomach, it feels kinda cold and uncomfortable. Extremely tired, very off balance and dizzy. Weird vision, I can see, it’s just weirdly fuzzy. Head pressure and I just feel like I’m gonna fall over or pass out constantly. It’s really debilitating and making me go crazy. I’m bringing up acid constantly too.

I’ve tried everything to stop this but nothing works. Does anyone else feel as bad as I do? I don’t work, or leave the house, I struggle to move. I even went to A+E yesterday because I was so shaky and dizzy but my bloods were all fine, I still didn’t feel any better after getting checked, it’s not health anxiety or anything like that, because the symptoms are non stop and never go away. My sleep seems okay, I don’t tend to wake up a lot in the night. Other than that I’m constantly feeling like I’m gonna die.",Lonely-Page-15,1,1,1743864598.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1js559x/this_cant_be_right/,Negative,Low Concern

1js4hv8,Peace,"I took this week to dig up all the monsters I could find.

It happens, and so many little things happened that ended up reaching my peak. Never seen before. In fact... my peak was a few years ago when I was around 12 years old, I don't have a good memory for those dates, but it was when I put a knife to my neck, but I didn't kill myself, because then I wouldn't be writing this message, right? 

(The jokes help ease the tension, sorry about them hehehehe)

I spent the night today (it's 11am, I woke up at 12am yesterday) awake, trying to help people, from this subreddit and r/depression, I tried to be a quick response help, even though I'm as in the shit as everyone else. I felt useful, even though I didn't help in the best way, I consider that having someone trying to help is something necessary. I was happy :)
 I ended up coming across the case of a girl, who asked me a question that I couldn't answer, because every time I tried, I realized that my text was bigger and bigger, with more detours and uncertainties, I started trying to write something at 4 am, I finished it at 10 am. This really hit me, I actually found one, or maybe more than one monster that terrifies me, I didn't take the time to look at them so well and understand them.
They scare me, they make me want to kill myself, seem like a good option, and honestly I'm so at peace, I would die, right now, smiling and calm.
I guess that's why I'm not crying now, I'm not seeing problems in death, even though I know she has them. I don't think I'm going to kill myself because it would require a will, and I don't think I have that will, much less the tools I would desire. I would like it to be something simple, quick and painless, so I wouldn't have to go through what I think I will have to go through in life. I don't feel good living. It's not healthy for me. And I would like to die 🙂, I think that's more what I'm going through now",eldanikyaki,1,0,1743862791.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1js4hv8/peace/,Positive,High Risk
1js0cz4,Let’s talk financial anxiety.,"So for two years my husband I struggled to find jobs in a new country that had enough hours for us to live comfortably. Of course having so little money and not being sure how I’d get by every month had a big effect on my mental health. I had to borrow money from my sister multiple times, which I hated as well.

We’ve now made it to the point where our rent is less than a fourth of our income and we’re able to save. We’ve saved enough for a  modest emergency fund, have stable jobs and housing and are debt free. You would think things would settle down for me now. 

But no, I’m still 100% mentally where I was 2 years ago. I obsessively check my bank account and seeing the money spent pending still gives me heart palpitations. I also constantly worry about bills coming per mail or there being unexpected expenses even though we would have money to cover it. 

Are you guys also struggling with this? Is this something one ever gets over as one’s bank account grows? At this point I feel like I’d feel the same if I had 100 grand in the bank…",No_Bother_9650,2,0,1743848488.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1js0cz4/lets_talk_financial_anxiety/,Positive,Moderate Concern

The sensation is persistent event as her anxiety levels fluctuate. Could this be related? Initially we thought the skin was nerve issue related.

1jrwo7t,My self sabotage due to anxiety,"Trigger warning: description of anxiety symptoms and implications 





I am (or used to be) a pre med student. Not to sound arrogant here but I had a great GPA and MCAT score. But now after a year of constant anxiety, it’s not looking too great for me academically. I couldn’t focus on anything and spent so much time lying in bed and being scared of just about anything. As a result my GPA has tanked. I’m in my final semester of undergrad and might fail a class or two despite them being super easy. I’ve pretty much erased my chances of med school, and even if I could get in, how would I even be able to function as a doctor if I’m scared of everything? And that’s not even getting into how much I’ve self sabotaged my social life and jobs. 

Just wanted to get this off my chest. ",delusional_ocd,4,2,1743832440.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1jrwo7t/my_self_sabotage_due_to_anxiety/,Negative,Low Concern

1jrxupq,"I'm trying to find a balance, and I'm failing.","So, what I have is a combination of depression, anxiety, and ""being different"" aka Aspergers slash autism. Yesterday, I pushed myself too hard to do ""professional"" things. I attended my school's cyberteam meeting for the first time in forever, and I pushed myself too far in the direction of information security. This ""professional"" stuff is so exhausting for me. Okay, so what have I been doing in the ""forever"" since I attended that cyberteam meeting? I've been focusing on stupid little trite hobbies. I don't mean to dismiss hobbies, but this commercialist nonsense just doesn't feel right to me. Yeah, but I couldn't try being more professional because that would lead my fatigue to a dangerous place.

Honestly, when I moved into that university in 2018, I began telling myself that ""everything is nothing,"" and that ""nothing is anything."" I've done that numerous times since moving into my apartment in 2019. That leads me to a very scary place very quickly. So, I amassed these idiotic hobbies to save myself. Regardless, my days are a nightmare. My energy is all over the place. I often stay awake all night so that I don't have to be awake during the day.

I feel happy when I'm with my best friend. My mother has even told me that! She's said, ""You're only happy when you're with Asha!"" That only happens about once a month, though! Okay, so I tried dating, but guess what? Any lady will see this from me, and she'll drop me like a trig class!  That's totally her right, of course.

I'm trying to find a balance, and I'm failing. That'd make a good title for this post. I'll type that as this post's title.
