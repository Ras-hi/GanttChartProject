1js4848,I chose not to die. I left loaded weapons on the table and walked to the hospital.,"I’m 38. I’ve been sober since 2018, married with a child, and on paper I’m doing well—career, family, stability. But inside, I’ve spent years quietly falling apart.

My first serious crash was at 22. I had gotten a girl pregnant, and before we could talk about it, she had an abortion without telling me. That destroyed me. I fell into a depression I couldn’t explain to anyone. I stopped going to class. I isolated. I drank. A lot.

One night, drunk and desperate, I emptied my bank account ($3,000) and bought a one-way Greyhound ticket to L.A. I never made it—I got robbed at the terminal, then arrested. The cops took me to a psych ward instead of jail. That might have saved my life.

Eventually I finished college. In 2011 I worked in Afghanistan with the military. We got hit with rocket attacks regularly, but I barely reacted. I wasn’t brave—I was numb. Nothing outside felt as intense as what was happening inside me.

At 27, I lost my job and ended up hospitalized again after another depressive spiral. The suicidal ideation had become familiar by that point. It would creep in and take over until I couldn’t tell if I was in danger or just tired of existing.

I didn’t stop drinking until I was 33. One morning, I left for the hospital with loaded weapons sitting on my coffee table. I made a choice not to die that day—and I’ve never forgotten it.

A doctor told me I had cirrhosis. That scared me sober. A year later, a liver specialist told me it was alcoholic hepatitis and that I’d recovered. Somehow, my body gave me a second chance.

Since then, I’ve stayed sober. I’ve been diagnosed with Major Depressive Disorder, and I’ve tried different meds. Some helped. Some triggered what I can only describe as months of euphoria. I spent thousands of dollars on Pokémon cards. I told myself it was “investing,” but really, I was spinning out.

When I crashed again, I ended up in the hospital for a week. The idea of bipolar has been brought up, but nothing formal. I don’t know what I am—other than confused.

Now, even with meds and sobriety, I’ve started raging at the smallest criticisms. It’s like this explosive anger just erupts from nowhere. I hate how it makes me feel. I hate the way it affects my wife and kid. I want to stop, but I don’t fully understand what’s happening inside me.

I’m doing everything I can. Therapy. Psychiatry. Meds. Honest reflection. And still—some days I feel like I’m right back on the edge I was at 10 years ago.

I guess I’m writing this because I needed to say it out loud. I don’t have a clean ending or an insight to offer. Just this:

I’m still here. Still trying.",Ateepeemadeofpeepee,88,18,1743861991.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1js4848/i_chose_not_to_die_i_left_loaded_weapons_on_the/,Negative,Moderate Concern,L.A.,13.206233749999999,120.61293821293518
1js3pns,I'mm so tired,"Hi, I have been going through it so I wanna open up. As u can read on the title I'mm very tired of life. I'm 23 years old man. I have been struggling with my mental health as long as I hit puberty. Anxiety, OCD and depression. My selfconfidence was destroyed when I was child/teen by my mother. I had no friends, I was always the weird kid. 

Since then i had therapy 2022-2023, but needed to stop because the moeny. I'm highly educated, moved away from my home town to nig city and got the job I was always dreaming about. Now I'm more sad and axious than ever. 

My job is very demanding and busy. My job is district secretary so I deal with very serious cases everyday. I'mm constantly messing things up, that prerssure is just not good for my mental health. Work is my whole life. it takes 95% of my days, first at work and when I'mm back home all I can do is stress abou things I didnt have time. Weekends are mostly stressing abou work. I have no friends because i moved here last summer. I meet new people but nobody stays and wants to keep having a friendship. 

  
I'm so alone, tired and stressed. Is there a way out and be happier?",WorthBodybuilder2312,2,2,1743860470.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1js3pns/imm_so_tired/,Negative,Moderate Concern,nig,9.6000359,7.9999721
1js1yup,can anyone help me figure out what's going on?,"Hi guys I'm 14 years old, I am from the Philippines, so my English may not be as good.

I have been seeing things like shadows, items that when I try touching them they disappear, random black bugs crawling around but when I turn to look at them they're not there.

I have been hearing my name being called at random times of day especially when I'm at school when no one's talking to me and random people laughing. 

All of the things mentioned above are just brief moments, and they have been happening for at least a year now. Also when these happen, I don't think im in a paranoid state nor am I worried about anything,

Recently, I've also been experiencing nightmares involving everyone I've ever loved leaving me or getting possessed, or just anything disturbing happening to them. My memories have also gotten foggier (I'm not sure if that's a word) and harder to remember, I've also seem to have gotten stupider.

My parents took me to a psychiatrist a year ago and they diagnosed me with bipolar disorder, they gave me meds for it (I don't take them anymore since they don't help) I don't think it's very much accurate because I don't think I have ever experienced a manic episode in my life. Recently my mom took me to a therapist and she told me that I might have asymptomatic depression, so I'm not sure if that contributes to what I'm experiencing rn

And before anyone says anything, I am not schizophrenic, nor have I ever experienced psychosis (I think), and I don't take drugs because I'm too young for that. That's all 4 now, if anyone with a similar experience sees this please help",QualityLegal4166,2,2,1743854800.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1js1yup/can_anyone_help_me_figure_out_whats_going_on/,Negative,Moderate Concern,Philippines,12.7503486,122.7312101
1jrwd28,I (23F) don't see a way out,"If you go to my post history, you can get a picture of how I got to where I am in life today. I am here today because of the choices I made. Currently I'm unemployed and I don't have a degree. I stay at home all day doing nothing. That's mainly how I've wasted the past five years of my life. I wish I went off to university, took it seriously, made a group of friends, and studied abroad. I wake up every day and think about how I would be studying abroad right now and the memories I would have made. There are no second chances since I come from a low income family. I ask myself why I did the things I did, even though I know that my family is working class. I don't come from a wealthy background so what made me think I had any time or money to waste? Now I am 5 years (which is a fucking long time) behind everyone and I'm watching all of my friends graduate, study in Europe (which I want but will never get to do due to finances, ruining my academic record, and running out of time), and make good money. There is literally no way to catch up to not just to my friends, but to the vision I had for my life. I also still live with my parents in the 570 sq ft one bedroom apartment that I grew up in (I sleep in the living room on a twin bed). I can't stand to live here anymore, but I'm broke. I don't even want to live in Canada anymore. Moving elsewhere likely wouldn't make me happier since I would be even more lonely than I am now. Getting a minimum wage job and moving out is not the solution because minimum wage/close to minimum wage is not sustainable for the rest of my life. The only thing I can feasibly do is get a bachelor's in nursing, but it feels like a last resort. I know I left myself with no choices. I really cannot see myself living in this city for the next 5-7 years and have been contemplating suicide. I really feel trapped and don't see a way out. I had a vision for my 20s, which would have started with a memorable time in university, but I not only missed the boat on that, I have wasted 5 years of youth that I will never get back and am left in a position where I'll be poor for a very long time. University would have been the most likely and easiest place for dating, but that option is closed to me forever. That environment is important to me because it would have been the most organic way to make friends and to meet someone my age to date. Now the time for fun has passed (during which I didn't even have fun), the only thing that's left is work, being poor, and loneliness.",Extreme-Book-1922,7,4,1743831147.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1jrwd28/i_23f_dont_see_a_way_out/,Negative,High Risk,Europe,51.0,10.0
1jrtgdf,Anxiety traveling abroad as a black immigrant under the current administration,"A friend and I have been planning a trip out of the country, but the insanity from the current administration detaining people under the guise of immigration enforcement is causing some immense anxiety. My friend is a black woman who is a naturalized US citizen, so she should be able to travel in and out of the country without having to worry about being detained, but the anxiety is still there because this administration doesn't seem to care about the law.

Has anybody (in particular, immigrants and/or people of color) traveled abroad and returned recently under the current administration? Can you share anything that may help ease my friend's anxiety on this? I am 100% ok with cancelling the trip to ease her anxiety, but she's been looking forward to this for so long and I would hate for it to be ruined by the orange asshole and his goons.",Left_Tradition8457,31,24,1743820695.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1jrtgdf/anxiety_traveling_abroad_as_a_black_immigrant/,Negative,Low Concern,US,39.7837304,-100.445882
1js3975,"I am done. Anxiety disorders have reduced my quality of life to miserable. Not homeless, got all 4 limbs BUT so what if I can't enjoy life regardless. CPTSD causing crushing bouts of prolonged severe anxiety turned out to be the last straw. BACK TO CLONAZEPAM (Klonopin).","Everyone either mention the two above, or having a family, or being able to get education...

...and I surely would appreciate, and DID appreciate life before...
...before repeated emotional trauma.
Additionally the exposure (a good non-pharm. coping/therapy method don't get me wrong!) was just a bit too far too soon and...messed me up even more.
I went through NINE semesters of med school 1.5 a year away from getting an M.D. title.
I broke down even more.

Alcohol makes my body feel poisoned, so I drowned my sorrows in benzos. Abused them.
Even though I MAY STILL GO BACK and FINISH...
I Broke down again, and again.

Started abusing both clonazepam and alprazolam but addiction to the latter for me was worse, because alprazolam (Xanax) lasts 4-5h and clonazepam (Klonopin Rivotril etc.) about 4 times as long.

My anxiety is all day-long and chronic but the trauma-related attacks of sheer panic are just soul crushing. Alprazolam won't do the trick because they can last for entire days.

I got diagnosed with ADHD in the meantime and by sheer miracle.
When I started failing med school due to anxiety making me a literal living mess, I got myself some Ritalin out of desperation for studying...kind of a forced ADHD diagnosis. A sin of mine that um paid off actually.

And thinking how it being a stimulant is basically the polar opposite of benzos these being CNS depressants or colloquially ""downers""...I was initially quite careful starting on 10mg.
Nothing.
Let's try 20mg said my doc a week after 10mg use.
""Ok"".

Dude. Helped my anxiety,
my depression,
my lack of energy and lethargic mindset,
 my boredom,
 my focus,
 my creativity...

Later down the line /a digresssion here/ it alleviated anxiety caused by XANAX WITHDRAWAL.
Then I paid attention and my strong black double Coffee slightly HELPS my anxiety too, unless I went further, but that's due to heart and BP obviously.

Took the tests, the funny simulated one, the questionare, evaluated by a psychologist/analyst...ADHD plain as day.

Later, my benzo habit got tapered, I got switched to Lyrica - pregabalin.
It worked wonders for generalized anxiety especially. 2 or 3 years and plop tolerance ruins all of it.
And 1200mg / 24h is no longer a medical dosing, and I get that.

Benzos got even more demonized than before but I had regretted so badly going overboard with them.

When Lyrica lost effectiveness...my main-line anxiolytic agent became...Ritalin. Or just methylphenidate as this was not the original formula.

I used twice as much methylphenidate as per doctors instructions.
When asked why - for anxiety, staggering the doses...since it fits with the dopamine fingers into my brain being a glove I could take 30mg instant release and go asleep.

But my new doc was kind enough to understand. Iost my will to seek new things educate myself make friends etc.
I'm 31. Sometimes I'm met with ""Ahh so young you shouldn't be taking such strong meds!""
When it comes to my own alley - that of mental anguish - that nearly drove me S. At worst point,
That caused me to become a chain smoker as first cig came a decade before getting Ritalin and never been able to quit - being at med school I got comments by my ""peers"", obviously,
and I may already be caring a mutation in my lower Airways up to 3 decades too soon...
...after my family members became distant as I'm a ""junkie"" if I plead for one medication that helps me function just-well-enough, and another that helps Save my sanity...

Doc gave me 2mg klonopin daily, dosed twice 1mg. Despite previous mistakes.
I'll never repeat them due to how much anguish this med can relieve. Never increase dose without asking psych doc. It's there and I already feel safer...
...which arrogant people will contribute to addiction despite having had a 3 year break, impossible physical aspect with mental diminished as if I F up and start abusing the med and chase that blasted dragon and eventually WILL have the med stopped forever - I wouldn't forgive myself

Currently 1mg - (5-6h) - 1mg considering clonazepam...

1. Pregabalin dropped from 1500mg daily to 900mg by using clonazepam for a week. Mind you, I'm V-E-R-Y dependent on this med. Goal is 600mg daily but at that point I'm fairly sure it won't work at all - and may quit altogether.

2. Methylphenidate (Ritalin) dropped from 108 mg [YEAH] (usually 40mg - 40mg - 28mg type deal immediate release 3h between doses).
Without propranolol additionally, (great nonaddictive med for somatic anxiety symptoms) hell my heart and BP would be too far...I wouldn't take it.
One week passed. From the average 108mg I went to 54mg daily taken in prolonged release formula.

So.
2mg of clonazepam dosed twice in 1mg doses for a week.

Results are,
1. Lyrica 1.5k mg /24h down by 600mg to 900mg
2. Ritalin used as per doctor's instruction. The abhorrent 108mg in spaced doses cut down by HALF into single 54mg XR formula. The Ritalin can now be used for ADHD proper and not handle ADHD AND anxiety disorders at once.

Hurr durr 2mg of clonazepam. Hurr durr BZD addict relapsing.


Humans and human life are too complicated to be put into 0 - 1ish labels of thinking.

My intention is by no means a glorification of clonazepam of benzos in general.

It's just that some people have less left to lose than meets the eye, and also, 5 years can give a lot to think through, mature, and maybe given how their lives are s*itty regardless and dose 2x max 24h medical max of two meds one no longer working another used off label due to necessity...

Well for me the effects are here. Once I go down to 600mg Lyrica daily so both meds are in medically allowed dose range..don't know.

The 2mg daily of clonazepam is 3 weeks tops but if things go messy and I start abusing another med, then clonazepam is back to action right away.



You don't have to suffer pointlessly.
